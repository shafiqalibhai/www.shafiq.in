### Economy and Industry

- Traditional industries (mining, textiles)
- Modern sectors and economic drivers (technology, education)

Mons has seen significant economic development throughout its history, with various industries playing crucial roles in shaping its current economic landscape. Historically, Mons was a prominent center for mining and textiles during the Industrial Revolution. Coal mining became the backbone of the local economy, attracting workers from all over Europe and fueling rapid urbanization. The discovery of coal led to the establishment of major mining companies, such as Société Anonyme des Mines de Charleroi et de la Sambre-et-Meuse, which contributed to significant economic growth in the region.

However, Mons has been proactive in adapting to these shifts by embracing new sectors that drive its contemporary economy. Today, the city's economic landscape is characterized by a mix of traditional and modern industries, with technology and education becoming increasingly significant.

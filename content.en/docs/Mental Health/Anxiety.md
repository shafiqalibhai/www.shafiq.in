# Anxiety

Anxiety is a common and normal emotion that we all experience from time to time. It can be triggered by various factors, such as stress, uncertainty, fear, or pressure. Anxiety can help us to cope with challenging situations, alert us to potential dangers, and motivate us to solve problems. However, anxiety can also become a problem if it interferes with our daily life, affects our well-being, or causes us distress. In this chapter, we will explore some practical tips that can help you overcome anxiety and improve your mental health.

## Tip 1: Understand your anxiety

The first step to overcoming anxiety is to understand what it is, what causes it, and how it affects you. Anxiety is not a single condition, but a broad term that covers different types of anxiety disorders, such as:

- Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) – feeling anxious or worried most of the time about various aspects of your life, such as work, health, or relationships¹.
- Panic disorder – having recurrent and unexpected panic attacks, which are sudden and intense episodes of fear or terror that cause physical symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness².
- Social anxiety disorder – feeling nervous or fearful in social situations, such as meeting new people, speaking in public, or eating in front of others³.
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) – having unwanted and intrusive thoughts (obsessions) that cause anxiety and performing repetitive behaviors (compulsions) to relieve the anxiety⁴.
- Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – having anxiety problems after experiencing a traumatic event, such as an accident, assault, or war.
- Phobias – having an intense and irrational fear of a specific object, situation, or animal, such as spiders, heights, or flying.

Anxiety disorders can have different causes and risk factors, such as:

- Genetics – having a family history of anxiety disorders can increase your chances of developing one.
- Personality – having certain personality traits, such as being shy, perfectionist, or self-critical can make you more prone to anxiety.
- Life events – experiencing stressful or traumatic events, such as abuse, loss, illness, or divorce can trigger or worsen anxiety.
- Environment – living in a chaotic or unsafe environment, such as a war zone, a violent neighborhood, or an abusive relationship can cause anxiety.
- Health conditions – having certain physical or mental health conditions, such as diabetes, asthma, heart disease, depression, or substance abuse can contribute to anxiety.

Anxiety can affect your body and mind in different ways. Some common symptoms of anxiety include:

- Feeling nervous, restless, or tense
- Having a sense of impending doom or danger
- Having an increased heart rate, sweating, trembling, or breathing difficulties
- Having trouble sleeping, concentrating, or remembering things
- Having stomach problems, headaches, or muscle pain
- Avoiding situations that make you anxious
- Having irrational or negative thoughts
- Feeling detached from yourself or reality

By understanding your anxiety better, you can identify the triggers and patterns of your anxiety and learn how to cope with them more effectively.

## Tip 2: Seek professional help

If your anxiety is severe or persistent and affects your daily functioning or quality of life,
you may benefit from seeking professional help. A mental health professional can help you:

- Diagnose your anxiety disorder and rule out any other medical conditions that may cause similar symptoms
- Provide you with evidence-based treatments that can reduce your anxiety and improve your well-being
- Support you in your recovery process and monitor your progress

Some common treatments for anxiety disorders include:

- Psychotherapy – a type of talking therapy that helps you understand and change the way you think,
feel,
and behave in relation to your anxiety. There are different types of psychotherapy,
such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT),
which teaches you how to challenge and reframe your negative thoughts,
and exposure therapy,
which helps you face your fears gradually and safely.
- Medication – a type of treatment that involves taking prescribed drugs that can help reduce the physical and emotional symptoms of anxiety. There are different types of medication for anxiety,
such as antidepressants,
which can balance the chemicals in your brain that affect your mood,
and benzodiazepines,
which can calm your nervous system and relax your muscles. However,
medication may have side effects,
such as drowsiness,
weight gain,
or addiction,
so you should always consult your doctor before taking any medication.
- Self-help – a type of treatment that involves using various resources and techniques that can help you manage your anxiety on your own. There are many self-help options for anxiety,
such as books,
websites,
apps,
online courses,
or support groups that can provide you with information,
advice,
and guidance on how to cope with anxiety.

You can access professional help for anxiety through various sources, such as:

- Your GP – your general practitioner can assess your symptoms, refer you to a specialist, prescribe medication, or suggest other services that can help you
- Your employer – your workplace may have an employee assistance program (EAP) that can offer you free and confidential counseling or other support for your mental health
- Your school or college – your educational institution may have a counseling service or a mental health team that can provide you with support and guidance for your anxiety
- Your local mental health service – your area may have a community mental health team (CMHT) or an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service that can offer you assessment and treatment for your anxiety
- A private therapist – you can find a qualified and registered therapist who can offer you psychotherapy for your anxiety through various websites, such as the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) or the UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP)

Seeking professional help for anxiety is not a sign of weakness or failure. It is a sign of courage and strength. You deserve to get the help you need and improve your mental health.

## Tip 3: Practice relaxation techniques

One of the most effective ways to cope with anxiety is to practice relaxation techniques that can help you calm your body and mind. Relaxation techniques can help you:

- Lower your heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle tension
- Reduce your stress hormones, such as cortisol and adrenaline
- Increase your endorphins, the natural painkillers and mood boosters in your brain
- Improve your mood, concentration, and sleep quality
- Enhance your immune system and overall health

Some common relaxation techniques for anxiety include:

- Deep breathing – a technique that involves breathing slowly and deeply from your diaphragm (the muscle below your lungs) rather than from your chest. Deep breathing can help you oxygenate your blood, relax your muscles, and calm your nervous system. To practice deep breathing, you can follow these steps:

  - Sit or lie down in a comfortable position and place one hand on your chest and the other on your stomach.
  - Breathe in through your nose for about four seconds, filling your stomach with air. You should feel your stomach rise while your chest stays still.
  - Hold your breath for about two seconds.
  - Breathe out through your mouth for about six seconds, emptying your stomach of air. You should feel your stomach fall while your chest stays still.
  - Repeat this cycle for about 10 minutes or until you feel relaxed.

- Progressive muscle relaxation – a technique that involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in your body one by one. Progressive muscle relaxation can help you release physical tension, become more aware of your body sensations, and distract yourself from anxious thoughts. To practice progressive muscle relaxation, you can follow these steps:

  - Sit or lie down in a comfortable position and close your eyes.
  - Start with your feet and work your way up to your face, focusing on one muscle group at a time.
  - Tense each muscle group as hard as you can for about five seconds, without hurting yourself. For example, curl your toes, clench your fists, or raise your eyebrows.
  - Relax each muscle group for about 10 seconds, feeling the difference between tension and relaxation. For example, uncurl your toes, open your fists, or lower your eyebrows.
  - Repeat this process for each muscle group until you have relaxed your whole body.

- Mindfulness meditation – a technique that involves paying attention to the present moment with curiosity and openness, without judging or reacting to it. Mindfulness meditation can help you become more aware of your thoughts, feelings, and sensations, accept them as they are, and let them go without getting stuck on them. To practice mindfulness meditation, you can follow these steps:

  - Sit or lie down in a comfortable position and close your eyes.
  - Bring your attention to your breathing, noticing the rise and fall of your chest or abdomen with each breath.
  - If any thoughts, feelings, or sensations arise in your mind, acknowledge them without judging or engaging with them. For example, say to yourself "I'm having a thought" or "I'm feeling anxious".
  - Gently bring your attention back to your breathing, without criticizing yourself for getting distracted.
  - Repeat this process for as long as you like, aiming for at least 10 minutes a day.

You can practice these relaxation techniques whenever you feel anxious or stressed, or as part of a daily routine to prevent anxiety from building up. You can also use other methods of relaxation that suit you best,
such as listening to music,
reading a book,
taking a bath,
or doing yoga.

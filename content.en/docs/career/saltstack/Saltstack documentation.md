archive.cmd_unzip:

    New in version 2015.5.0
        In versions 2014.7.x and earlier, this function was known as
        ``archive.unzip``.

    Uses the ``unzip`` command to unpack zip files. This command is part of the
    `Info-ZIP`_ suite of tools, and is typically packaged as simply ``unzip``.

    .. _`Info-ZIP`: http://www.info-zip.org/

    zip_file
        Path of zip file to be unpacked

    dest
        The destination directory into which the file should be unpacked

    excludes : None
        Comma-separated list of files not to unpack. Can also be passed in a
        Python list.

    template : None
        Can be set to 'jinja' or another supported template engine to render
        the command arguments before execution:

            salt '*' archive.cmd_unzip template=jinja /tmp/zipfile.zip '/tmp/{{grains.id}}' excludes=file_1,file_2

    options
        Optional when using ``zip`` archives, ignored when usign other archives
        files. This is mostly used to overwrite existing files with ``o``.
        This options are only used when ``unzip`` binary is used.

        New in version 2016.3.1

    runas : None
        Unpack the zip file as the specified user. Defaults to the user under
        which the minion is running.

        New in version 2015.5.0

    trim_output : False
        The number of files we should output on success before the rest are trimmed, if this is
        set to True then it will default to 100

    password
        Password to use with password protected zip files

        Note:
            This is not considered secure. It is recommended to instead use
            :py:func:`archive.unzip <salt.modules.archive.unzip>` for
            password-protected ZIP files. If a password is used here, then the
            unzip command run to extract the ZIP file will not show up in the
            minion log like most shell commands Salt runs do. However, the
            password will still be present in the events logged to the minion
            log at the ``debug`` log level. If the minion is logging at
            ``debug`` (or more verbose), then be advised that the password will
            appear in the log.

        New in version 2016.11.0

archive.cmd_zip:

    New in version 2015.5.0
        In versions 2014.7.x and earlier, this function was known as
        ``archive.zip``.

    Uses the ``zip`` command to create zip files. This command is part of the
    `Info-ZIP`_ suite of tools, and is typically packaged as simply ``zip``.

        the command arguments before execution:

            salt '*' archive.cmd_zip template=jinja /tmp/zipfile.zip /tmp/sourcefile1,/tmp/{{grains.id}}.txt

    cwd : None
        Use this argument along with relative paths in ``sources`` to create
        zip files which do not contain the leading directories. If not
        specified, the zip file will be created as if the cwd was ``/``, and
        creating a zip file of ``/foo/bar/baz.txt`` will contain the parent
        directories ``foo`` and ``bar``. To create a zip file containing just
        ``baz.txt``, the following command would be used:

            salt '*' archive.cmd_zip /tmp/baz.zip baz.txt cwd=/foo/bar

        New in version 2014.7.1

    runas : None
        Create the zip file as the specified user. Defaults to the user under
        which the minion is running.

        New in version 2015.5.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' archive.cmd_zip /tmp/zipfile.zip /tmp/sourcefile1,/tmp/sourcefile2
        # Globbing for sources (2017.7.0 and later)
        salt '*' archive.cmd_zip /tmp/zipfile.zip '/tmp/sourcefile*'

        salt '*' archive.gzip /tmp/sourcefile.txt options='-9 --verbose'
    

archive.is_encrypted:

    New in version 2016.11.0
    Changed in version 3005

    Returns ``True`` if the zip archive is password-protected, ``False`` if
    not. If the specified file is not a ZIP archive, an error will be raised.

    name
        The path / URL of the archive to check.

    clean : False
        Set this value to ``True`` to delete the path referred to by ``name``
        once the contents have been listed. This option should be used with
        care.

        Note:
            If there is an error listing the archive's contents, the cached
            file will not be removed, to allow for troubleshooting.

    saltenv : base
        Specifies the fileserver environment from which to retrieve
        ``archive``. This is only applicable when ``archive`` is a file from
        the ``salt://`` fileserver.

    source_hash
        If ``name`` is an http(s)/ftp URL and the file exists in the minion's
        file cache, this option can be passed to keep the minion from
        re-downloading the archive if the cached copy matches the specified
        hash.

        New in version 2018.3.0

    use_etag
        If ``True``, remote http/https file sources will attempt to use the
        ETag header to determine if the remote file needs to be downloaded.
        This provides a lightweight mechanism for promptly refreshing files
        changed on a web server without requiring a full hash comparison via
        the ``source_hash`` parameter.

        New in version 3005

    CLI Examples:

archive.list:

    New in version 2016.11.0
    Changed in version 2016.11.2,3005
        The rarfile_ Python module is now supported for listing the contents of
        rar archives. This is necessary on minions with older releases of the
        ``rar`` CLI tool, which do not support listing the contents in a
        parsable format.

    .. _rarfile: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rarfile

    List the files and directories in an tar, zip, or rar archive.

    Note:
        This function will only provide results for XZ-compressed archives if
        the xz_ CLI command is available, as Python does not at this time
        natively support XZ compression in its tarfile_ module. Keep in mind
        however that most Linux distros ship with xz_ already installed.

        To check if a given minion has xz_, the following Salt command can be
        run:

            salt minion_id cmd.which xz

        If ``None`` is returned, then xz_ is not present and must be installed.
        It is widely available and should be packaged as either ``xz`` or
        ``xz-utils``.

    name
        Path/URL of archive

    archive_format
        Specify the format of the archive (``tar``, ``zip``, or ``rar``). If
        this argument is omitted, the archive format will be guessed based on
        the value of the ``name`` parameter.

    options
        **For tar archives only.** This function will, by default, try to use
        the tarfile_ module from the Python standard library to get a list of
        files/directories. If this method fails, then it will fall back to
        using the shell to decompress the archive to stdout and pipe the
        results to ``tar -tf -`` to produce a list of filenames. XZ-compressed
        archives are already supported automatically, but in the event that the
        tar archive uses a different sort of compression not supported natively
        by tarfile_, this option can be used to specify a command that will
        decompress the archive to stdout. For example:

            salt minion_id archive.list /path/to/foo.tar.gz options='gzip --decompress --stdout'

        Note:
            It is not necessary to manually specify options for gzip'ed
            archives, as gzip compression is natively supported by tarfile_.

    strip_components
        This argument specifies a number of top-level directories to strip from
        the results. This is similar to the paths that would be extracted if
        ``--strip-components`` (or ``--strip``) were used when extracting tar
        archives.

        New in version 2016.11.2

    clean : False
        Set this value to ``True`` to delete the path referred to by ``name``
        once the contents have been listed. This option should be used with
        care.

        Note:
            If there is an error listing the archive's contents, the cached
            file will not be removed, to allow for troubleshooting.

    verbose : False
        If ``False``, this function will return a list of files/dirs in the
        archive. If ``True``, it will return a dictionary categorizing the
        paths into separate keys containing the directory names, file names,
        and also directories/files present in the top level of the archive.

        Changed in version 2016.11.2
            This option now includes symlinks in their own list. Before, they
            were included with files.

    saltenv : base
        Specifies the fileserver environment from which to retrieve
        ``archive``. This is only applicable when ``archive`` is a file from
        the ``salt://`` fileserver.

    source_hash
        If ``name`` is an http(s)/ftp URL and the file exists in the minion's
        file cache, this option can be passed to keep the minion from
        re-downloading the archive if the cached copy matches the specified
        hash.

        New in version 2018.3.0

    use_etag

        Comma-separated list of sources to include in the rar file. Sources can
        also be passed in a Python list.

        Changed in version 2017.7.0
            Globbing is now supported for this argument

    cwd : None
        Run the rar command from the specified directory. Use this argument
        along with relative file paths to create rar files which do not
        contain the leading directories. If not specified, this will default
        to the home directory of the user under which the salt minion process
        is running.

        New in version 2014.7.1

    template : None
        Can be set to 'jinja' or another supported template engine to render
        the command arguments before execution:

            salt '*' archive.rar template=jinja /tmp/rarfile.rar '/tmp/sourcefile1,/tmp/{{grains.id}}.txt'

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' archive.rar /tmp/rarfile.rar /tmp/sourcefile1,/tmp/sourcefile2
        # Globbing for sources (2017.7.0 and later)
        salt '*' archive.rar /tmp/rarfile.rar '/tmp/sourcefile*'
    

archive.tar:

    Note:

        This function has changed for version 0.17.0. In prior versions, the
        ``cwd`` and ``template`` arguments must be specified, with the source
        directories/files coming as a space-separated list at the end of the
        command. Beginning with 0.17.0, ``sources`` must be a comma-separated
        list, and the ``cwd`` and ``template`` arguments are optional.

    Uses the tar command to pack, unpack, etc. tar files


    options
        Options to pass to the tar command

        Changed in version 2015.8.0

            The mandatory `-` prefixing has been removed.  An options string
            beginning with a `--long-option`, would have uncharacteristically
            needed its first `-` removed under the former scheme.

            Also, tar will parse its options differently if short options are
            used with or without a preceding `-`, so it is better to not
            confuse the user into thinking they're using the non-`-` format,
            when really they are using the with-`-` format.

    tarfile
        The filename of the tar archive to pack/unpack

    sources
        Comma delimited list of files to **pack** into the tarfile. Can also be
        passed as a Python list.

        Changed in version 2017.7.0
            Globbing is now supported for this argument

    dest
        The destination directory into which to **unpack** the tarfile

    cwd : None
        The directory in which the tar command should be executed. If not
        specified, will default to the home directory of the user under which
        the salt minion process is running.

    template : None
        Can be set to 'jinja' or another supported template engine to render
        the command arguments before execution:

            salt '*' archive.tar cjvf /tmp/salt.tar.bz2 {{grains.saltpath}} template=jinja

    CLI Examples:

        # Create a tarfile
        salt '*' archive.tar cjvf /tmp/tarfile.tar.bz2 /tmp/file_1,/tmp/file_2
        # Create a tarfile using globbing (2017.7.0 and later)

    trim_output : False
        The number of files we should output on success before the rest are trimmed, if this is
        set to True then it will default to 100

    CLI Example:

archive.unzip:

    Uses the ``zipfile`` Python module to unpack zip files

    Changed in version 2015.5.0
        This function was rewritten to use Python's native zip file support.
        The old functionality has been preserved in the new function
        :mod:`archive.cmd_unzip <salt.modules.archive.cmd_unzip>`. For versions
        2014.7.x and earlier, see the :mod:`archive.cmd_zip
        <salt.modules.archive.cmd_zip>` documentation.

    password
        Password to use with password protected zip files

        Note:
            The password will be present in the events logged to the minion log
            file at the ``debug`` log level. If the minion is logging at
            ``debug`` (or more verbose), then be advised that the password will
            appear in the log.

        New in version 2016.3.0

    extract_perms : True
        The Python zipfile_ module does not extract file/directory attributes
        by default. When this argument is set to ``True``, Salt will attempt to
        apply the file permission attributes to the extracted files/folders.

        On Windows, only the read-only flag will be extracted as set within the
        zip file, other attributes (i.e. user/group permissions) are ignored.

        Set this argument to ``False`` to disable this behavior.

        This function was rewritten to use Python's native zip file support.
        The old functionality has been preserved in the new function
        :mod:`archive.cmd_zip <salt.modules.archive.cmd_zip>`. For versions
        2014.7.x and earlier, see the :mod:`archive.cmd_zip
        <salt.modules.archive.cmd_zip>` documentation.

    zip_file
        Path of zip file to be created

    sources
        Comma-separated list of sources to include in the zip file. Sources can
        also be passed in a Python list.

        Changed in version 2017.7.0
            Globbing is now supported for this argument

    template : None
        Can be set to 'jinja' or another supported template engine to render
        the command arguments before execution:

            salt '*' archive.zip template=jinja /tmp/zipfile.zip /tmp/sourcefile1,/tmp/{{grains.id}}.txt

    cwd : None
        Use this argument along with relative paths in ``sources`` to create
        zip files which do not contain the leading directories. If not
        specified, the zip file will be created as if the cwd was ``/``, and
        creating a zip file of ``/foo/bar/baz.txt`` will contain the parent
        directories ``foo`` and ``bar``. To create a zip file containing just
        ``baz.txt``, the following command would be used:

            salt '*' archive.zip /tmp/baz.zip baz.txt cwd=/foo/bar

    runas : None
        Create the zip file as the specified user. Defaults to the user under
        which the minion is running.

    zip64 : False
        Used to enable ZIP64 support, necessary to create archives larger than
        4 GByte in size.
        If true, will create ZIP file with the ZIPp64 extension when the zipfile
        is larger than 2 GB.
        ZIP64 extension is disabled by default in the Python native zip support
        because the default zip and unzip commands on Unix (the InfoZIP utilities)
        don't support these extensions.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' archive.zip /tmp/zipfile.zip /tmp/sourcefile1,/tmp/sourcefile2
        # Globbing for sources (2017.7.0 and later)
        salt '*' archive.zip /tmp/zipfile.zip '/tmp/sourcefile*'

        Consult F5 BIGIP user guide for specific options for each monitor type.
        Typically, tmsh arg names are used.

    Creating Complex Args
        Profiles can get pretty complicated in terms of the amount of possible
        config options. Use the following shorthand to create complex arguments such
        as lists, dictionaries, and lists of dictionaries. An option is also
        provided to pass raw json as well.

        lists ``[i,i,i]``:
            ``param='item1,item2,item3'``

        Dictionary ``[k:v,k:v,k,v]``:
            ``param='key-1:val-1,key-2:val2,key-3:va-3'``

        List of Dictionaries ``[k:v,k:v|k:v,k:v|k:v,k:v]``:
           ``param='key-1:val-1,key-2:val-2|key-1:val-1,key-2:val-2|key-1:val-1,key-2:val-2'``

        JSON: ``'j{ ... }j'``:
           ``cert-key-chain='j{ "default": { "cert": "default.crt", "chain": "default.crt", "key": "default.key" } }j'``

        Escaping Delimiters:
            Use ``\,`` or ``\:`` or ``\|`` to escape characters which shouldn't
            be treated as delimiters i.e. ``ciphers='DEFAULT\:!SSLv3'``

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' bigip.create_profile bigip admin admin http my-http-profile defaultsFrom='/Common/http'
        salt '*' bigip.create_profile bigip admin admin http my-http-profile defaultsFrom='/Common/http' \

    Creating Complex Args

        Profiles can get pretty complicated in terms of the amount of possible
        config options. Use the following shorthand to create complex arguments such
        as lists, dictionaries, and lists of dictionaries. An option is also
        provided to pass raw json as well.

        lists ``[i,i,i]``:
            ``param='item1,item2,item3'``

        Dictionary ``[k:v,k:v,k,v]``:
            ``param='key-1:val-1,key-2:val2,key-3:va-3'``

        List of Dictionaries ``[k:v,k:v|k:v,k:v|k:v,k:v]``:
           ``param='key-1:val-1,key-2:val-2|key-1:val-1,key-2:val-2|key-1:val-1,key-2:val-2'``

        JSON: ``'j{ ... }j'``:
           ``cert-key-chain='j{ "default": { "cert": "default.crt", "chain": "default.crt", "key": "default.key" } }j'``

        Escaping Delimiters:
            Use ``\,`` or ``\:`` or ``\|`` to escape characters which shouldn't
            be treated as delimiters i.e. ``ciphers='DEFAULT\:!SSLv3'``

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' bigip.modify_profile bigip admin admin http my-http-profile defaultsFrom='/Common/http'

        salt '*' bigip.modify_profile bigip admin admin http my-http-profile defaultsFrom='/Common/http' \

        salt '*' btrfs.add /mountpoint /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2
    

btrfs.convert:

    Convert ext2/3/4 to BTRFS. Device should be mounted.

    Filesystem can be converted temporarily so the further processing and rollback is possible,
    or permanently, where previous extended filesystem image gets deleted. Please note, permanent
    conversion takes a while as BTRFS filesystem needs to be properly rebalanced afterwards.

    General options:

    * **permanent**: Specify if the migration should be permanent (false by default)
    * **keeplf**: Keep ``lost+found`` of the partition (removed by default,
                  but still in the image, if not permanent migration)

    * **nodesize**: Node size.
    * **leafsize**: Specify the nodesize, the tree block size in which btrfs stores data.
    * **noforce**: Prevent force overwrite when an existing filesystem is detected on the device.
    * **sectorsize**: Specify the sectorsize, the minimum data block allocation unit.
    * **nodiscard**: Do not perform whole device TRIM operation by default.
    * **uuid**: Pass UUID or pass True to generate one.


    Options:

    * **dto**: (raid0|raid1|raid5|raid6|raid10|single|dup)
               Specify how the data must be spanned across the devices specified.
    * **mto**: (raid0|raid1|raid5|raid6|raid10|single|dup)
               Specify how metadata must be spanned across the devices specified.

        salt '*' cmd.exec_code_all ruby 'puts "cheese"' args='["arg1", "arg2"]' env='{"FOO": "bar"}'
    

cmd.has_exec:

    Returns true if the executable is available on the minion, false otherwise

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cmd.has_exec cat
    

cmd.powershell:

    Execute the passed PowerShell command and return the output as a dictionary.

    Other ``cmd.*`` functions (besides ``cmd.powershell_all``)
    return the raw text output of the command. This
    function appends ``| ConvertTo-JSON`` to the command and then parses the
    JSON into a Python dictionary. If you want the raw textual result of your
    PowerShell command you should use ``cmd.run`` with the ``shell=powershell``
    option.

    For example:

        salt '*' cmd.run '$PSVersionTable.CLRVersion' shell=powershell
        salt '*' cmd.run 'Get-NetTCPConnection' shell=powershell

    New in version 2016.3.0

    Warning:

        This passes the cmd argument directly to PowerShell
        without any further processing! Be absolutely sure that you
        have properly sanitized the command passed to this function
        and do not use untrusted inputs.

    In addition to the normal ``cmd.run`` parameters, this command offers the
    ``depth`` parameter to change the Windows default depth for the
    ``ConvertTo-JSON`` powershell command. The Windows default is 2. If you need
    more depth, set that here.

    Note:
        For some commands, setting the depth to a value greater than 4 greatly
        increases the time it takes for the command to return and in many cases
        returns useless data.

    :param str cmd: The powershell command to run.

    :param str cwd: The directory from which to execute the command. Defaults
        to the home directory of the user specified by ``runas`` (or the user
        under which Salt is running if ``runas`` is not specified).

    :param str stdin: A string of standard input can be specified for the
      command to be run using the ``stdin`` parameter. This can be useful in cases
      where sensitive information must be read from standard input.

    :param str runas: Specify an alternate user to run the command. The default
        behavior is to run as the user under which Salt is running. If running
        on a Windows minion you must also use the ``password`` argument, and
        the target user account must be in the Administrators group.

    :param str password: Windows only. Required when specifying ``runas``. This
      parameter will be ignored on non-Windows platforms.

      New in version 2016.3.0

    :param str shell: Specify an alternate shell. Defaults to "powershell". Can
        also use "pwsh" for powershell core if present on the system

    :param bool python_shell: If False, let python handle the positional
      arguments. Set to True to use shell features, such as pipes or
      redirection.

    :param dict env: Environment variables to be set prior to execution.

        Note:
            When passing environment variables on the CLI, they should be
            passed as the string representation of a dictionary.

                salt myminion cmd.powershell 'some command' env='{"FOO": "bar"}'

        Note:
            When using environment variables on Window's, case-sensitivity
            matters, i.e. Window's uses `Path` as opposed to `PATH` for other
            systems.

    :param bool clean_env: Attempt to clean out all other shell environment
        variables and set only those provided in the 'env' argument to this

    :param str template: If this setting is applied then the named templating
        engine will be used to render the downloaded file. Currently jinja,
        mako, and wempy are supported.

    :param bool rstrip: Strip all whitespace off the end of output before it is
        returned.

    :param str umask: The umask (in octal) to use when running the command.

    :param str output_encoding: Control the encoding used to decode the
        command's output.

        Note:
            This should not need to be used in most cases. By default, Salt
            will try to use the encoding detected from the system locale, and
            will fall back to UTF-8 if this fails. This should only need to be
            used in cases where the output of the command is encoded in
            something other than the system locale or UTF-8.

            To see the encoding Salt has detected from the system locale, check
            the `locale` line in the output of :py:func:`test.versions_report
            <salt.modules.test.versions_report>`.

        the command is logged to the minion log.

        Note:
            The command being run will still be logged at the ``debug``
            loglevel regardless, unless ``quiet`` is used for this value.

    :param bool ignore_retcode: If the exit code of the command is nonzero,
        this is treated as an error condition, and the output from the command
        will be logged to the minion log. However, there are some cases where
        programs use the return code for signaling and a nonzero exit code
        doesn't necessarily mean failure. Pass this argument as ``True`` to
        skip logging the output if the command has a nonzero exit code.

    :param bool hide_output: If ``True``, suppress stdout and stderr in the
        return data.

        Note:
            This is separate from ``output_loglevel``, which only handles how
            Salt logs to the minion log.

    :param bool reset_system_locale: Resets the system locale

    :param str saltenv: The salt environment to use. Default is 'base'

    :param int depth: The number of levels of contained objects to be included.
        Default is 2. Values greater than 4 seem to greatly increase the time
        it takes for the command to complete for some commands. eg: ``dir``

    :returns:
        :dict: A dictionary of data returned by the powershell command.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cmd.powershell "$PSVersionTable.CLRVersion"
    

cmd.powershell_all:

    Execute the passed PowerShell command and return a dictionary with a result
    field representing the output of the command, as well as other fields
    showing us what the PowerShell invocation wrote to ``stderr``, the process
    id, and the exit code of the invocation.

    This function appends ``| ConvertTo-JSON`` to the command before actually
    invoking powershell.

    An unquoted empty string is not valid JSON, but it's very normal for the
    Powershell output to be exactly that. Therefore, we do not attempt to parse
    empty Powershell output (which would result in an exception). Instead we
    treat this as a special case and one of two things will happen:

    - If the value of the ``force_list`` parameter is ``True``, then the
      ``result`` field of the return dictionary will be an empty list.

    - If the value of the ``force_list`` parameter is ``False``, then the
      return dictionary **will not have a result key added to it**. We aren't
      setting ``result`` to ``None`` in this case, because ``None`` is the
      Python representation of "null" in JSON. (We likewise can't use ``False``
      for the equivalent reason.)

    If Powershell's output is not an empty string and Python cannot parse its
    content, then a ``CommandExecutionError`` exception will be raised.

    If Powershell's output is not an empty string, Python is able to parse its
    content, and the type of the resulting Python object is other than ``list``
    then one of two things will happen:

    - If the value of the ``force_list`` parameter is ``True``, then the
      ``result`` field will be a singleton list with the Python object as its
      sole member.

    - If the value of the ``force_list`` parameter is ``False``, then the value
      of ``result`` will be the unmodified Python object.

    If Powershell's output is not an empty string, Python is able to parse its
    content, and the type of the resulting Python object is ``list``, then the
    value of ``result`` will be the unmodified Python object. The
    ``force_list`` parameter has no effect in this case.

    Note:
         An example of why the ``force_list`` parameter is useful is as
         follows: The Powershell command ``dir x | Convert-ToJson`` results in

         - no output when x is an empty directory.
         - a dictionary object when x contains just one item.
         - a list of dictionary objects when x contains multiple items.

         By setting ``force_list`` to ``True`` we will always end up with a
         list of dictionary items, representing files, no matter how many files
         x contains.  Conversely, if ``force_list`` is ``False``, we will end
         up with no ``result`` key in our return dictionary when x is an empty
         directory, and a dictionary object when x contains just one file.

    If you want a similar function but with a raw textual result instead of a
    Python dictionary, you should use ``cmd.run_all`` in combination with
    ``shell=powershell``.

    The remaining fields in the return dictionary are described in more detail
    in the ``Returns`` section.

    Example:

        salt '*' cmd.run_all '$PSVersionTable.CLRVersion' shell=powershell
        salt '*' cmd.run_all 'Get-NetTCPConnection' shell=powershell

    :param bool stdin_raw_newlines: False
        If ``True``, Salt will not automatically convert the characters ``\n``
        present in the ``stdin`` value to newlines.

      New in version 2019.2.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cmd.retcode "file /bin/bash"

    The template arg can be set to 'jinja' or another supported template
    engine to render the command arguments before execution.
    For example:

        salt '*' cmd.retcode template=jinja "file {{grains.pythonpath[0]}}/python"

    A string of standard input can be specified for the command to be run using
    the ``stdin`` parameter. This can be useful in cases where sensitive
    information must be read from standard input.

        salt '*' cmd.retcode "grep f" stdin='one\ntwo\nthree\nfour\nfive\n'
    

cmd.run:

    Execute the passed command and return the output as a string

    :param str cmd: The command to run. ex: ``ls -lart /home``

    :param str cwd: The directory from which to execute the command. Defaults
        to the home directory of the user specified by ``runas`` (or the user
        under which Salt is running if ``runas`` is not specified).

    :param str stdin: A string of standard input can be specified for the
        command to be run using the ``stdin`` parameter. This can be useful in
        cases where sensitive information must be read from standard input.

    :param str runas: Specify an alternate user to run the command. The default
        behavior is to run as the user under which Salt is running.

        Warning:

            For versions 2018.3.3 and above on macosx while using runas,
            on linux while using run, to pass special characters to the
            command you need to escape the characters on the shell.

            Example:

                cmd.run 'echo '\''h=\"baz\"'\''' runas=macuser

    :param str group: Group to run command as. Not currently supported
        on Windows.

    :param str password: Windows only. Required when specifying ``runas``. This
        parameter will be ignored on non-Windows platforms.

        New in version 2016.3.0

    :param str shell: Specify an alternate shell. Defaults to the system's
        default shell.

    :param bool python_shell: If ``False``, let python handle the positional
        arguments. Set to ``True`` to use shell features, such as pipes or
        redirection.

    :param bool bg: If ``True``, run command in background and do not await or
        deliver its results

        New in version 2016.3.0

    :param dict env: Environment variables to be set prior to execution.

        Note:
            When passing environment variables on the CLI, they should be
            passed as the string representation of a dictionary.

                salt myminion cmd.run 'some command' env='{"FOO": "bar"}'

        Note:
            When using environment variables on Window's, case-sensitivity
            matters, i.e. Window's uses `Path` as opposed to `PATH` for other
            systems.

    :param bool clean_env: Attempt to clean out all other shell environment
        variables and set only those provided in the 'env' argument to this
        function.

    :param str prepend_path: $PATH segment to prepend (trailing ':' not
        necessary) to $PATH

        New in version 2018.3.0

    :param str template: If this setting is applied then the named templating

    :param bool rstrip: Strip all whitespace off the end of output before it is
        returned.

    :param str umask: The umask (in octal) to use when running the command.

    :param str output_encoding: Control the encoding used to decode the
        command's output.

        Note:
            This should not need to be used in most cases. By default, Salt
            will try to use the encoding detected from the system locale, and
            will fall back to UTF-8 if this fails. This should only need to be
            used in cases where the output of the command is encoded in
            something other than the system locale or UTF-8.

            To see the encoding Salt has detected from the system locale, check
            the `locale` line in the output of :py:func:`test.versions_report
            <salt.modules.test.versions_report>`.

        New in version 2018.3.0

    :param str output_loglevel: Control the loglevel at which the output from
        the command is logged to the minion log.

        Note:
            The command being run will still be logged at the ``debug``
            loglevel regardless, unless ``quiet`` is used for this value.

    :param bool ignore_retcode: If the exit code of the command is nonzero,
        this is treated as an error condition, and the output from the command
        will be logged to the minion log. However, there are some cases where
        programs use the return code for signaling and a nonzero exit code
        doesn't necessarily mean failure. Pass this argument as ``True`` to
        skip logging the output if the command has a nonzero exit code.

    :param bool hide_output: If ``True``, suppress stdout and stderr in the
        return data.

        Note:
            This is separate from ``output_loglevel``, which only handles how
            Salt logs to the minion log.

        New in version 2018.3.0

    :param int timeout: A timeout in seconds for the executed process to return.

    :param bool use_vt: Use VT utils (saltstack) to stream the command output
        more interactively to the console and the logs. This is experimental.

    :param bool redirect_stderr: If set to ``True``, then stderr will be
        redirected to stdout. This is helpful for cases where obtaining both
        the retcode and output is desired. Default is ``True``

        New in version 3006.9

    :param bool encoded_cmd: Specify if the supplied command is encoded.
        Only applies to shell 'powershell' and 'pwsh'.

        New in version 2018.3.0

        Older versions of powershell seem to return raw xml data in the return.
        To avoid raw xml data in the return, prepend your command with the
        following before encoding:

        `$ProgressPreference='SilentlyContinue'; <your command>`

        The following powershell code block will encode the `Write-Output`
        command so that it will not have the raw xml data in the return:

            # target string
            $Command = '$ProgressPreference="SilentlyContinue"; Write-Output "hello"'

            # Convert to Base64 encoded string
            $Encoded = [convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($command))

            Write-Output $Encoded

    :param bool raise_err: If ``True`` and the command has a nonzero exit code,
        a CommandExecutionError exception will be raised.

    Warning:
        This function does not process commands through a shell
        unless the python_shell flag is set to True. This means that any
        shell-specific functionality such as 'echo' or the use of pipes,
        redirection or &&, should either be migrated to cmd.shell or
        have the python_shell=True flag set here.

        The use of python_shell=True means that the shell will accept _any_ input
        including potentially malicious commands such as 'good_command;rm -rf /'.
        Be absolutely certain that you have sanitized your input prior to using
        python_shell=True

    :param list success_retcodes: This parameter will allow a list of
        non-zero return codes that should be considered a success.  If the
        return code returned from the run matches any in the provided list,
        the return code will be overridden with zero.

    :param int windows_codepage: 65001
        Only applies to Windows: the minion uses `C:\Windows\System32\chcp.com` to
        verify or set the code page before the command `cmd` is executed.
        Code page 65001 corresponds with UTF-8 and allows international localization of Windows.

      New in version 3002

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cmd.run "ls -l | awk '/foo/{print \\$2}'"

    The template arg can be set to 'jinja' or another supported template
    engine to render the command arguments before execution.
    For example:

        salt '*' cmd.run template=jinja "ls -l /tmp/{{grains.id}} | awk '/foo/{print \\$2}'"

    Specify an alternate shell with the shell parameter:

        salt '*' cmd.run "Get-ChildItem C:\\ " shell='powershell'

    A string of standard input can be specified for the command to be run using
    the ``stdin`` parameter. This can be useful in cases where sensitive
    information must be read from standard input.

        salt '*' cmd.run "grep f" stdin='one\\ntwo\\nthree\\nfour\\nfive\\n'

    If an equal sign (``=``) appears in an argument to a Salt command it is
    interpreted as a keyword argument in the format ``key=val``. That
    processing can be bypassed in order to pass an equal sign through to the
    remote shell command by manually specifying the kwarg:

        salt '*' cmd.run cmd='sed -e s/=/:/g'
    

cmd.run_all:

    Execute the passed command and return a dict of return data

    :param str cmd: The command to run. ex: ``ls -lart /home``

    :param str cwd: The directory from which to execute the command. Defaults
        to the home directory of the user specified by ``runas`` (or the user
        under which Salt is running if ``runas`` is not specified).

    :param str stdin: A string of standard input can be specified for the
        command to be run using the ``stdin`` parameter. This can be useful in
        cases where sensitive information must be read from standard input.

    :param str runas: Specify an alternate user to run the command. The default
        behavior is to run as the user under which Salt is running. If running
        on a Windows minion you must also use the ``password`` argument, and
        the target user account must be in the Administrators group.

        Warning:

            For versions 2018.3.3 and above on macosx while using runas,
            to pass special characters to the command you need to escape
            the characters on the shell.

            Example:

                cmd.run_all 'echo '\''h=\"baz\"'\''' runas=macuser

        ``python_shell`` argument is set to ``True``. This means that any
        shell-specific functionality such as 'echo' or the use of pipes,
        redirection or &&, should either be migrated to cmd.shell or have the
        python_shell=True flag set here.

        The use of ``python_shell=True`` means that the shell will accept _any_
        input including potentially malicious commands such as 'good_command;rm
        -rf /'.  Be absolutely certain that you have sanitized your input prior
        to using ``python_shell=True``.

    :param list success_retcodes: This parameter will allow a list of
        non-zero return codes that should be considered a success.  If the
        return code returned from the run matches any in the provided list,
        the return code will be overridden with zero.

      New in version 2019.2.0

    :param list success_stdout: This parameter will allow a list of
        strings that when found in standard out should be considered a success.
        If stdout returned from the run matches any in the provided list,
        the return code will be overridden with zero.

      New in version 3004

    :param list success_stderr: This parameter will allow a list of
        strings that when found in standard error should be considered a success.
        If stderr returned from the run matches any in the provided list,
        the return code will be overridden with zero.

      New in version 3004

    :param bool stdin_raw_newlines: False
        If ``True``, Salt will not automatically convert the characters ``\\n``
        present in the ``stdin`` value to newlines.

      New in version 2019.2.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cmd.run_bg "fstrim-all"

    The template arg can be set to 'jinja' or another supported template
    engine to render the command arguments before execution.
    For example:

        salt '*' cmd.run_bg template=jinja "ls -l /tmp/{{grains.id}} | awk '/foo/{print \\$2}'"

    Specify an alternate shell with the shell parameter:

        salt '*' cmd.run_bg "Get-ChildItem C:\\ " shell='powershell'

    If an equal sign (``=``) appears in an argument to a Salt command it is
    interpreted as a keyword argument in the format ``key=val``. That
    processing can be bypassed in order to pass an equal sign through to the
    remote shell command by manually specifying the kwarg:

        salt '*' cmd.run_bg cmd='ls -lR / | sed -e s/=/:/g > /tmp/dontwait'
    

cmd.run_chroot:

    New in version 2014.7.0

    This function runs :mod:`cmd.run_all <salt.modules.cmdmod.run_all>` wrapped
    within a chroot, with dev and proc mounted in the chroot

    :param str root: Path to the root of the jail to use.

    :param str stdin: A string of standard input can be specified for
        the command to be run using the ``stdin`` parameter. This can
        be useful in cases where sensitive information must be read
        from standard input.:

    :param str runas: User to run script as.

    :param str group: Group to run script as.

    :param str shell: Shell to execute under. Defaults to the system
        default shell.

    :param str cmd: The command to run. ex: ``ls -lart /home``

    :param str cwd: The directory from which to execute the command. Defaults
        to the home directory of the user specified by ``runas`` (or the user
        under which Salt is running if ``runas`` is not specified).

    :parar str stdin: A string of standard input can be specified for the
        command to be run using the ``stdin`` parameter. This can be useful in
        cases where sensitive information must be read from standard input.

    :param str runas: Specify an alternate user to run the command. The default
        behavior is to run as the user under which Salt is running. If running
        on a Windows minion you must also use the ``password`` argument, and
        the target user account must be in the Administrators group.

    :param str shell: Specify an alternate shell. Defaults to the system's
        default shell.

    :param bool python_shell: If False, let python handle the positional
        arguments. Set to True to use shell features, such as pipes or
        redirection.

    :param list binds: List of directories that will be exported inside
        the chroot with the bind option.

        New in version 3000

    :param dict env: Environment variables to be set prior to execution.

        Note:
            When passing environment variables on the CLI, they should be
            passed as the string representation of a dictionary.

                salt myminion cmd.run_chroot 'some command' env='{"FOO": "bar"}'

        Note:
            When using environment variables on Window's, case-sensitivity
            matters, i.e. Window's uses `Path` as opposed to `PATH` for other
            systems.

    :param dict clean_env: Attempt to clean out all other shell environment
        variables and set only those provided in the 'env' argument to this
        function.

    :param str template: If this setting is applied then the named templating
        engine will be used to render the downloaded file. Currently jinja,
        mako, and wempy are supported.

    :param bool rstrip: Strip all whitespace off the end of output
        before it is returned.

    :param str umask: The umask (in octal) to use when running the
         command.

    :param str output_encoding: Control the encoding used to decode the
        command's output.

        Note:
            This should not need to be used in most cases. By default, Salt
            will try to use the encoding detected from the system locale, and
            will fall back to UTF-8 if this fails. This should only need to be
            used in cases where the output of the command is encoded in
            something other than the system locale or UTF-8.

            To see the encoding Salt has detected from the system locale, check
            the `locale` line in the output of :py:func:`test.versions_report
            <salt.modules.test.versions_report>`.

        New in version 2018.3.0

    :param str output_loglevel: Control the loglevel at which the output from
        the command is logged to the minion log.

        Note:
            The command being run will still be logged at the ``debug``
            loglevel regardless, unless ``quiet`` is used for this value.

    :param bool ignore_retcode: If the exit code of the command is nonzero,
        this is treated as an error condition, and the output from the command
        will be logged to the minion log. However, there are some cases where
        programs use the return code for signaling and a nonzero exit code
        doesn't necessarily mean failure. Pass this argument as ``True`` to
        skip logging the output if the command has a nonzero exit code.

    :param bool hide_output: If ``True``, suppress stdout and stderr in the
        return data.

        Note:
            This is separate from ``output_loglevel``, which only handles how
            Salt logs to the minion log.

        New in version 2018.3.0

    :param int timeout:
        A timeout in seconds for the executed process to return.

    :param bool use_vt:

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cmd.run_chroot /var/lib/lxc/container_name/rootfs 'sh /tmp/bootstrap.sh'
    

cmd.run_stderr:

    Execute a command and only return the standard error

    :param str cmd: The command to run. ex: ``ls -lart /home``

    :param str cwd: The directory from which to execute the command. Defaults
        to the home directory of the user specified by ``runas`` (or the user
        under which Salt is running if ``runas`` is not specified).

    :param str stdin: A string of standard input can be specified for the
        command to be run using the ``stdin`` parameter. This can be useful in
        cases where sensitive information must be read from standard input.

        on a Windows minion you must also use the ``password`` argument, and
        the target user account must be in the Administrators group.

        Warning:

            For versions 2018.3.3 and above on macosx while using runas,
            to pass special characters to the command you need to escape
            the characters on the shell.

            Example:

                cmd.run_stderr 'echo '\''h=\"baz\"'\''' runas=macuser

    :param str password: Windows only. Required when specifying ``runas``. This
        parameter will be ignored on non-Windows platforms.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cmd.run_stdout "ls -l | awk '/foo/{print \$2}'"

    The template arg can be set to 'jinja' or another supported template
    engine to render the command arguments before execution.
    For example:

        salt '*' cmd.run_stdout template=jinja "ls -l /tmp/{{grains.id}} | awk '/foo/{print \$2}'"

    A string of standard input can be specified for the command to be run using

cmd.script:

    Download a script from a remote location and execute the script locally.
    The script can be located on the salt master file server or on an HTTP/FTP
    server.

    The script will be executed directly, so it can be written in any available
    programming language.

    :param str source: The location of the script to download. If the file is
        located on the master in the directory named spam, and is called eggs,
        the source string is salt://spam/eggs

    :param str args: String of command line args to pass to the script. Only
        used if no args are specified as part of the `name` argument. To pass a
        string containing spaces in YAML, you will need to doubly-quote it:

            salt myminion cmd.script salt://foo.sh "arg1 'arg two' arg3"

    :param str cwd: The directory from which to execute the command. Defaults
        to the directory returned from Python's tempfile.mkstemp.

    :param str stdin: A string of standard input can be specified for the
        command to be run using the ``stdin`` parameter. This can be useful in
        cases where sensitive information must be read from standard input.

    :param str runas: Specify an alternate user to run the command. The default
        behavior is to run as the user under which Salt is running. If running
        on a Windows minion you must also use the ``password`` argument, and
        the target user account must be in the Administrators group.

        Note:

            For Window's users, specifically Server users, it may be necessary
            to specify your runas user using the User Logon Name instead of the
            legacy logon name. Traditionally, logons would be in the following
            format.

                ``Domain/user``

            In the event this causes issues when executing scripts, use the UPN
            format which looks like the following.

                ``user@domain.local``

            More information <https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/55080>

    :param str password: Windows only. Required when specifying ``runas``. This
        parameter will be ignored on non-Windows platforms.

        New in version 2016.3.0

    :param str group: Group to run script as. Not currently supported
      on Windows.

    :param str shell: Specify an alternate shell. Defaults to the system's
        default shell.

    :param bool python_shell: If False, let python handle the positional
        arguments. Set to True to use shell features, such as pipes or
        redirection.

    :param bool bg: If True, run script in background and do not await or
        deliver its results

    :param dict env: Environment variables to be set prior to execution.

        Note:
            When passing environment variables on the CLI, they should be
            passed as the string representation of a dictionary.

                salt myminion cmd.script 'some command' env='{"FOO": "bar"}'

        Note:
            When using environment variables on Window's, case-sensitivity
            matters, i.e. Window's uses `Path` as opposed to `PATH` for other
            systems.

    :param str template: If this setting is applied then the named templating
        engine will be used to render the downloaded file. Currently jinja,
        mako, and wempy are supported.

    :param str umask: The umask (in octal) to use when running the command.

    :param str output_encoding: Control the encoding used to decode the
        command's output.

        Note:
            This should not need to be used in most cases. By default, Salt
            will try to use the encoding detected from the system locale, and
            will fall back to UTF-8 if this fails. This should only need to be
            used in cases where the output of the command is encoded in
            something other than the system locale or UTF-8.

            To see the encoding Salt has detected from the system locale, check
            the `locale` line in the output of :py:func:`test.versions_report
            <salt.modules.test.versions_report>`.

        New in version 2018.3.0

    :param str output_loglevel: Control the loglevel at which the output from
        the command is logged to the minion log.

        Note:
            The command being run will still be logged at the ``debug``
            loglevel regardless, unless ``quiet`` is used for this value.

    :param bool ignore_retcode: If the exit code of the command is nonzero,
        this is treated as an error condition, and the output from the command
        will be logged to the minion log. However, there are some cases where
        programs use the return code for signaling and a nonzero exit code
        doesn't necessarily mean failure. Pass this argument as ``True`` to
        skip logging the output if the command has a nonzero exit code.

    :param bool hide_output: If ``True``, suppress stdout and stderr in the
        return data.

        Note:
            This is separate from ``output_loglevel``, which only handles how
            Salt logs to the minion log.

        New in version 2018.3.0

    :param int timeout: If the command has not terminated after timeout
        seconds, send the subprocess sigterm, and if sigterm is ignored, follow
        up with sigkill

    :param bool use_vt: Use VT utils (saltstack) to stream the command output
        more interactively to the console and the logs. This is experimental.

    :param list success_retcodes: This parameter will allow a list of
        non-zero return codes that should be considered a success.  If the
        return code returned from the run matches any in the provided list,
        the return code will be overridden with zero.

      New in version 2019.2.0

    :param list success_stdout: This parameter will allow a list of
        strings that when found in standard out should be considered a success.
        If stdout returned from the run matches any in the provided list,
        the return code will be overridden with zero.

      New in version 3004

    :param list success_stderr: This parameter will allow a list of
        strings that when found in standard error should be considered a success.

    :param bool stdin_raw_newlines: False
        If ``True``, Salt will not automatically convert the characters ``\n``
        present in the ``stdin`` value to newlines.

      New in version 2019.2.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cmd.script salt://scripts/runme.sh
        salt '*' cmd.script salt://scripts/runme.sh 'arg1 arg2 "arg 3"'
        salt '*' cmd.script salt://scripts/windows_task.ps1 args=' -Input c:\tmp\infile.txt' shell='powershell'


        salt '*' cmd.script salt://scripts/runme.sh stdin='one\ntwo\nthree\nfour\nfive\n'
    

cmd.script_retcode:

    Download a script from a remote location and execute the script locally.
    The script can be located on the salt master file server or on an HTTP/FTP
    server.

    The script will be executed directly, so it can be written in any available
    programming language.

    The script can also be formatted as a template, the default is jinja.

    Only evaluate the script return code and do not block for terminal output

    :param str source: The location of the script to download. If the file is
        located on the master in the directory named spam, and is called eggs,
        the source string is salt://spam/eggs

    :param str args: String of command line args to pass to the script. Only
        used if no args are specified as part of the `name` argument. To pass a
        string containing spaces in YAML, you will need to doubly-quote it:
        "arg1 'arg two' arg3"

    :param str cwd: The directory from which to execute the command. Defaults
        to the home directory of the user specified by ``runas`` (or the user
        under which Salt is running if ``runas`` is not specified).

    :param str stdin: A string of standard input can be specified for the
        command to be run using the ``stdin`` parameter. This can be useful in
        cases where sensitive information must be read from standard input.

    :param str runas: Specify an alternate user to run the command. The default
        behavior is to run as the user under which Salt is running. If running
        on a Windows minion you must also use the ``password`` argument, and
        the target user account must be in the Administrators group.

    :param str password: Windows only. Required when specifying ``runas``. This
        parameter will be ignored on non-Windows platforms.

        New in version 2016.3.0

    :param str group: Group to run script as. Not currently supported
      on Windows.

    :param str shell: Specify an alternate shell. Defaults to the system's

        salt '*' cmd.script_retcode salt://scripts/windows_task.ps1 args=' -Input c:\tmp\infile.txt' shell='powershell'

    A string of standard input can be specified for the command to be run using
    the ``stdin`` parameter. This can be useful in cases where sensitive
    information must be read from standard input.

        salt '*' cmd.script_retcode salt://scripts/runme.sh stdin='one\ntwo\nthree\nfour\nfive\n'
    

cmd.shell:

    Execute the passed command and return the output as a string.

    New in version 2015.5.0

    :param str cmd: The command to run. ex: ``ls -lart /home``

    :param str cwd: The directory from which to execute the command. Defaults
        to the home directory of the user specified by ``runas`` (or the user
        under which Salt is running if ``runas`` is not specified).

    :param str stdin: A string of standard input can be specified for the
        command to be run using the ``stdin`` parameter. This can be useful in

        on a Windows minion you must also use the ``password`` argument, and
        the target user account must be in the Administrators group.

        Warning:

            For versions 2018.3.3 and above on macosx while using runas,
            to pass special characters to the command you need to escape
            the characters on the shell.

            Example:

                cmd.shell 'echo '\''h=\"baz\"'\''' runas=macuser

    :param str group: Group to run command as. Not currently supported

    :param bool clean_env: Attempt to clean out all other shell environment
        variables and set only those provided in the 'env' argument to this
        function.

    :param str prepend_path: $PATH segment to prepend (trailing ':' not necessary)
        to $PATH

        New in version 2018.3.0

    :param bool use_vt: Use VT utils (saltstack) to stream the command output
        more interactively to the console and the logs. This is experimental.

    Warning:

        This passes the cmd argument directly to the shell without any further
        processing! Be absolutely sure that you have properly sanitized the
        command passed to this function and do not use untrusted inputs.

    :param list success_retcodes: This parameter will allow a list of
        non-zero return codes that should be considered a success.  If the

        If ``True``, Salt will not automatically convert the characters ``\n``
        present in the ``stdin`` value to newlines.

      New in version 2019.2.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cmd.shell "ls -l | awk '/foo/{print \$2}'"

    The template arg can be set to 'jinja' or another supported template
    engine to render the command arguments before execution.
    For example:

        salt '*' cmd.shell template=jinja "ls -l /tmp/{{grains.id}} | awk '/foo/{print \$2}'"

    Specify an alternate shell with the shell parameter:

        salt '*' cmd.shell "Get-ChildItem C:\ " shell='powershell'

    A string of standard input can be specified for the command to be run using
    the ``stdin`` parameter. This can be useful in cases where sensitive
    information must be read from standard input.

        salt '*' cmd.shell "grep f" stdin='one\ntwo\nthree\nfour\nfive\n'

    If an equal sign (``=``) appears in an argument to a Salt command it is
    interpreted as a keyword argument in the format ``key=val``. That
    processing can be bypassed in order to pass an equal sign through to the
    remote shell command by manually specifying the kwarg:

        salt '*' cmd.shell cmd='sed -e s/=/:/g'
    

cmd.shell_info:

    New in version 2016.11.0

    Provides information about a shell or script languages which often use
    ``#!``. The values returned are dependent on the shell or scripting
    languages all return the ``installed``, ``path``, ``version``,
    ``version_raw``

    Args:
        shell (str): Name of the shell. Support shells/script languages include
        bash, cmd, perl, php, powershell, python, ruby and zsh

        list_modules (bool): True to list modules available to the shell.
        Currently only lists powershell modules.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary of information about the shell

        {'version': '<2 or 3 numeric components dot-separated>',
         'version_raw': '<full version string>',
         'path': '<full path to binary>',
         'installed': <True, False or None>,
         '<attribute>': '<attribute value>'}

    Note:
        - ``installed`` is always returned, if ``None`` or ``False`` also
          returns error and may also return ``stdout`` for diagnostics.
        - ``version`` is for use in determine if a shell/script language has a
          particular feature set, not for package management.
        - The shell must be within the executable search path.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cmd.shell_info bash
        salt '*' cmd.shell_info powershell

config.gather_bootstrap_script:

    Download the salt-bootstrap script, and return its location

    bootstrap

config.get:

    New in version 0.14.0

    Attempt to retrieve the named value from the minion config file, pillar,
    grains or the master config. If the named value is not available, return
    the value specified by the ``default`` argument. If this argument is not
    specified, ``default`` falls back to an empty string.

    Values can also be retrieved from nested dictionaries. Assume the below
    data structure:

        {'pkg': {'apache': 'httpd'}}

    To retrieve the value associated with the ``apache`` key, in the
    sub-dictionary corresponding to the ``pkg`` key, the following command can
    be used:

        salt myminion config.get pkg:apache

    The ``:`` (colon) is used to represent a nested dictionary level.

    Changed in version 2015.5.0
        The ``delimiter`` argument was added, to allow delimiters other than
        ``:`` to be used.

    This function traverses these data stores in this order, returning the
    first match found:

    - Minion configuration
    - Minion's grains
    - Minion's pillar data
    - Master configuration (requires :conf_minion:`pillar_opts` to be set to
      ``True`` in Minion config file in order to work)

    This means that if there is a value that is going to be the same for the
    majority of minions, it can be configured in the Master config file, and
    then overridden using the grains, pillar, or Minion config file.

    Adding config options to the Master or Minion configuration file is easy:

        my-config-option: value
        cafe-menu:
          - egg and bacon
          - egg sausage and bacon
          - egg and spam
          - egg bacon and spam
          - egg bacon sausage and spam
          - spam bacon sausage and spam
          - spam egg spam spam bacon and spam
          - spam sausage spam spam bacon spam tomato and spam

    Note:
        Minion configuration options built into Salt (like those defined
        :ref:`here <configuration-salt-minion>`) will *always* be defined in
        the Minion configuration and thus *cannot be overridden by grains or
        pillar data*. However, additional (user-defined) configuration options
        (as in the above example) will not be in the Minion configuration by
        default and thus can be overridden using grains/pillar data by leaving
        the option out of the minion config file.

    **Arguments**

    delimiter
        New in version 2015.5.0

        Override the delimiter used to separate nested levels of a data
        structure.

    merge
        New in version 2015.5.0

        If passed, this parameter will change the behavior of the function so
        that, instead of traversing each data store above in order and
        returning the first match, the data stores are first merged together
        and then searched. The pillar data is merged into the master config
        data, then the grains are merged, followed by the Minion config data.
        The resulting data structure is then searched for a match. This allows
        for configurations to be more flexible.

        Note:

            The merging described above does not mean that grain data will end
            up in the Minion's pillar data, or pillar data will end up in the
            master config data, etc. The data is just combined for the purposes
            of searching an amalgam of the different data stores.

        The supported merge strategies are as follows:

        - **recurse** - If a key exists in both dictionaries, and the new value
          is not a dictionary, it is replaced. Otherwise, the sub-dictionaries
          are merged together into a single dictionary, recursively on down,
          following the same criteria. For example:

              >>> dict1 = {'foo': {'bar': 1, 'qux': True},
                           'hosts': ['a', 'b', 'c'],
                           'only_x': None}
              >>> dict2 = {'foo': {'baz': 2, 'qux': False},
                           'hosts': ['d', 'e', 'f'],
                           'only_y': None}
              >>> merged
              {'foo': {'bar': 1, 'baz': 2, 'qux': False},
               'hosts': ['d', 'e', 'f'],
               'only_dict1': None,
               'only_dict2': None}

        - **overwrite** - If a key exists in the top level of both
          dictionaries, the new value completely overwrites the old. For
          example:

              >>> dict1 = {'foo': {'bar': 1, 'qux': True},
                           'hosts': ['a', 'b', 'c'],
                           'only_x': None}
              >>> dict2 = {'foo': {'baz': 2, 'qux': False},
                           'hosts': ['d', 'e', 'f'],
                           'only_y': None}
              >>> merged
              {'foo': {'baz': 2, 'qux': False},
               'hosts': ['d', 'e', 'f'],
               'only_dict1': None,
               'only_dict2': None}

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' config.get pkg:apache
        salt '*' config.get lxc.container_profile:centos merge=recurse
    

config.items:

    Return the complete config from the currently running minion process.
    This includes defaults for values not set in the config file.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' config.items
    

config.manage_mode:

    Return a mode value, normalized to a string

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' config.manage_mode
    

config.merge:

    Retrieves an option based on key, merging all matches.

    Same as ``option()`` except that it merges all matches, rather than taking
    the first match.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' config.merge schedule
    

config.option:

    Returns the setting for the specified config value. The priority for
    matches is the same as in :py:func:`config.get <salt.modules.config.get>`,
    only this function does not recurse into nested data structures. Another
    difference between this function and :py:func:`config.get
    <salt.modules.config.get>` is that it comes with a set of "sane defaults".
    To view these, you can run the following command:

        salt '*' config.option '*' omit_all=True wildcard=True

    default
        The default value if no match is found. If not specified, then the
        fallback default will be an empty string, unless ``wildcard=True``, in
        which case the return will be an empty dictionary.

    omit_opts : False
        Pass as ``True`` to exclude matches from the minion configuration file

    omit_grains : False
        Pass as ``True`` to exclude matches from the grains

    omit_pillar : False
        Pass as ``True`` to exclude matches from the pillar data

    omit_master : False
        Pass as ``True`` to exclude matches from the master configuration file

    omit_all : True
        Shorthand to omit all of the above and return matches only from the
        "sane defaults".

        New in version 3000

    wildcard : False
        If used, this will perform pattern matching on keys. Note that this
        will also significantly change the return data. Instead of only a value
        being returned, a dictionary mapping the matched keys to their values
        is returned. For example, using ``wildcard=True`` with a ``key`` of
        ``'foo.ba*`` could return a dictionary like so:

            {'foo.bar': True, 'foo.baz': False}

        New in version 3000

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' config.option redis.host
    

config.valid_fileproto:

    Returns a boolean value based on whether or not the URI passed has a valid
    remote file protocol designation

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' config.valid_fileproto salt://path/to/file

                  this however makes sense for their application.
    :param cas: This flag is used to turn the PUT into a
                Check-And-Set operation.
    :param acquire: This flag is used to turn the PUT into a
                    lock acquisition operation.

                   include the default "serfHealth".
    :param behavior: Can be set to either release or delete. This controls
                     the behavior when a session is invalidated. By default,
                     this is release, causing any locks that are held to be
                     released. Changing this to delete causes any locks that
                     are held to be deleted. delete is useful for creating
                     ephemeral key/value entries.

cp.cache_dest:

    New in version 3000

    Changed in version 3005
        ``saltenv`` will use value from config if not explicitly set

    Returns the expected cache path for the file, if cached using
    :py:func:`cp.cache_file <salt.modules.cp.cache_file>`.

    Note:
        This only returns the _expected_ path, it does not tell you if the URL
        is really cached. To check if the URL is cached, use
        :py:func:`cp.is_cached <salt.modules.cp.is_cached>` instead.

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' cp.cache_dest https://foo.com/bar.rpm
        salt '*' cp.cache_dest salt://my/file
        salt '*' cp.cache_dest salt://my/file saltenv=dev
    

cp.cache_dir:

    Changed in version 3005
        ``saltenv`` will use value from config if not explicitly set

    Download and cache everything under a directory from the master


    include_pat : None
        Glob or regex to narrow down the files cached from the given path. If
        matching with a regex, the regex must be prefixed with ``E@``,
        otherwise the expression will be interpreted as a glob.

        New in version 2014.7.0

    exclude_pat : None
        Glob or regex to exclude certain files from being cached from the given
        path. If matching with a regex, the regex must be prefixed with ``E@``,
        otherwise the expression will be interpreted as a glob.

        Note:

            If used with ``include_pat``, files matching this pattern will be
            excluded from the subset of files defined by ``include_pat``.

        New in version 2014.7.0

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' cp.cache_dir salt://path/to/dir
        salt '*' cp.cache_dir salt://path/to/dir include_pat='E@*.py$'
    

cp.cache_file:

    Changed in version 3005
        ``saltenv`` will use value from config if not explicitly set

    Used to cache a single file on the Minion

    Returns the location of the new cached file on the Minion

    source_hash
        If ``name`` is an http(s) or ftp URL and the file exists in the
        minion's file cache, this option can be passed to keep the minion from
        re-downloading the file if the cached copy matches the specified hash.

        New in version 2018.3.0

    verify_ssl
        If ``False``, remote https file sources (``https://``) and source_hash
        will not attempt to validate the servers certificate. Default is True.

        New in version 3002

    use_etag
        If ``True``, remote http/https file sources will attempt to use the
        ETag header to determine if the remote file needs to be downloaded.
        This provides a lightweight mechanism for promptly refreshing files
        changed on a web server without requiring a full hash comparison via
        the ``source_hash`` parameter.

        New in version 3005

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cp.cache_file salt://path/to/file

    There are two ways of defining the fileserver environment (a.k.a.
    ``saltenv``) from which to cache the file. One is to use the ``saltenv``
    parameter, and the other is to use a querystring syntax in the ``salt://``
    URL. The below two examples are equivalent:

        salt '*' cp.cache_file salt://foo/bar.conf saltenv=config
        salt '*' cp.cache_file salt://foo/bar.conf?saltenv=config

    If the path being cached is a ``salt://`` URI, and the path does not exist,
    then ``False`` will be returned.

    Note:
        It may be necessary to quote the URL when using the querystring method,
        depending on the shell being used to run the command.
    

cp.cache_file_ssh:

This function is an alias of ``cache_file``.

    Changed in version 3005
        ``saltenv`` will use value from config if not explicitly set

    Used to cache a single file on the Minion

    Returns the location of the new cached file on the Minion

    source_hash
        If ``name`` is an http(s) or ftp URL and the file exists in the
        minion's file cache, this option can be passed to keep the minion from
        re-downloading the file if the cached copy matches the specified hash.

        New in version 2018.3.0

    verify_ssl
        If ``False``, remote https file sources (``https://``) and source_hash
        will not attempt to validate the servers certificate. Default is True.

        New in version 3002

    use_etag
        If ``True``, remote http/https file sources will attempt to use the
        ETag header to determine if the remote file needs to be downloaded.
        This provides a lightweight mechanism for promptly refreshing files
        changed on a web server without requiring a full hash comparison via
        the ``source_hash`` parameter.

        New in version 3005

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cp.cache_file salt://path/to/file

    There are two ways of defining the fileserver environment (a.k.a.
    ``saltenv``) from which to cache the file. One is to use the ``saltenv``
    parameter, and the other is to use a querystring syntax in the ``salt://``
    URL. The below two examples are equivalent:

        salt '*' cp.cache_file salt://foo/bar.conf saltenv=config
        salt '*' cp.cache_file salt://foo/bar.conf?saltenv=config

    If the path being cached is a ``salt://`` URI, and the path does not exist,
    then ``False`` will be returned.

    Note:
        It may be necessary to quote the URL when using the querystring method,
        depending on the shell being used to run the command.
    

cp.cache_files:

    Changed in version 3005
        ``saltenv`` will use value from config if not explicitly set

    Used to gather many files from the Master, the gathered files will be
    saved in the minion cachedir reflective to the paths retrieved from the
    Master

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cp.cache_files salt://pathto/file1,salt://pathto/file1

    There are two ways of defining the fileserver environment (a.k.a.
    ``saltenv``) from which to cache the files. One is to use the ``saltenv``
    parameter, and the other is to use a querystring syntax in the ``salt://``
    URL. The below two examples are equivalent:

        salt '*' cp.cache_files salt://foo/bar.conf,salt://foo/baz.conf saltenv=config
        salt '*' cp.cache_files salt://foo/bar.conf?saltenv=config,salt://foo/baz.conf?saltenv=config

    The querystring method is less useful when all files are being cached from
    the same environment, but is a good way of caching files from multiple
    different environments in the same command. For example, the below command
    will cache the first file from the ``config1`` environment, and the second
    one from the ``config2`` environment.

        salt '*' cp.cache_files salt://foo/bar.conf?saltenv=config1,salt://foo/bar.conf?saltenv=config2

    Note:
        It may be necessary to quote the URL when using the querystring method,
        depending on the shell being used to run the command.
    

cp.cache_local_file:

    Cache a local file on the minion in the localfiles cache

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cp.cache_local_file /etc/hosts
    

cp.cache_master:

    Changed in version 3005
        ``saltenv`` will use value from config if not explicitly set

    Retrieve all of the files on the master and cache them locally

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cp.cache_master
    

cp.envs:

    List available environments for fileserver

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cp.envs
    

cp.get_dir:

    Changed in version 3005
        ``saltenv`` will use value from config if not explicitly set

    Used to recursively copy a directory from the salt master

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cp.get_dir salt://path/to/dir/ /minion/dest

    get_dir supports the same template and gzip arguments as get_file.
    

cp.get_file:

    Changed in version 3005
        ``saltenv`` will use value from config if not explicitly set

    Changed in version 2018.3.0
        ``dest`` can now be a directory

    Used to get a single file from the salt master

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cp.get_file salt://path/to/file /minion/dest

    Template rendering can be enabled on both the source and destination file
    names like so:

        salt '*' cp.get_file "salt://{{grains.os}}/vimrc" /etc/vimrc template=jinja

    This example would instruct all Salt minions to download the vimrc from a
    directory with the same name as their os grain and copy it to /etc/vimrc

    For larger files, the cp.get_file module also supports gzip compression.
    Because gzip is CPU-intensive, this should only be used in scenarios where
    the compression ratio is very high (e.g. pretty-printed JSON or YAML
    files).

    Use the *gzip* named argument to enable it.  Valid values are 1..9, where 1
    is the lightest compression and 9 the heaviest.  1 uses the least CPU on
    the master (and minion), 9 uses the most.

    There are two ways of defining the fileserver environment (a.k.a.
    ``saltenv``) from which to retrieve the file. One is to use the ``saltenv``
    parameter, and the other is to use a querystring syntax in the ``salt://``
    URL. The below two examples are equivalent:

        salt '*' cp.get_file salt://foo/bar.conf /etc/foo/bar.conf saltenv=config
        salt '*' cp.get_file salt://foo/bar.conf?saltenv=config /etc/foo/bar.conf

    Note:
        It may be necessary to quote the URL when using the querystring method,
        depending on the shell being used to run the command.
    

cp.get_file_str:

    Changed in version 3005
        ``saltenv`` will use value from config if not explicitly set

    Download a file from a URL to the Minion cache directory and return the
    contents of that file

    Returns ``False`` if Salt was unable to cache a file from a URL.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cp.get_file_str salt://my/file
    

cp.get_template:

    Changed in version 3005
        ``saltenv`` will use value from config if not explicitly set

    Render a file as a template before setting it down.
    Warning, order is not the same as in fileclient.cp for
    non breaking old API.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cp.get_template salt://path/to/template /minion/dest
    

cp.get_url:

    Changed in version 3005
        ``saltenv`` will use value from config if not explicitly set

    Changed in version 2018.3.0
        ``dest`` can now be a directory

    Used to get a single file from a URL.

    path
        A URL to download a file from. Supported URL schemes are: ``salt://``,
        ``http://``, ``https://``, ``ftp://``, ``s3://``, ``swift://`` and
        ``file://`` (local filesystem). If no scheme was specified, this is
        equivalent of using ``file://``.
        If a ``file://`` URL is given, the function just returns absolute path
        to that file on a local filesystem.
        The function returns ``False`` if Salt was unable to fetch a file from
        a ``salt://`` URL.

    dest
        The default behaviour is to write the fetched file to the given
        destination path. If this parameter is omitted or set as empty string
        (``''``), the function places the remote file on the local filesystem
        inside the Minion cache directory and returns the path to that file.

        Note:

            To simply return the file contents instead, set destination to
            ``None``. This works with ``salt://``, ``http://``, ``https://``
            and ``file://`` URLs. The files fetched by ``http://`` and
            ``https://`` will not be cached.

    saltenv
        Salt fileserver environment from which to retrieve the file. Ignored if
        ``path`` is not a ``salt://`` URL.

    source_hash
        If ``path`` is an http(s) or ftp URL and the file exists in the
        minion's file cache, this option can be passed to keep the minion from
        re-downloading the file if the cached copy matches the specified hash.

        New in version 2018.3.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' cp.get_url salt://my/file /tmp/this_file_is_mine

    for matching specific files using globbing.

    New in version 2014.7.0

    Since this feature allows a minion to push files up to the master server it
    is disabled by default for security purposes. To enable, set ``file_recv``
    to ``True`` in the master configuration file, and restart the master.

defaults.deepcopy:

    defaults.deepcopy
        Allows deep copy of objects in formulas.

        By default, Python does not copy objects,
        it creates bindings between a target and an object.

    It is more typical to use this in a templating language in formulas,
    instead of directly on the command-line.
    

defaults.get:

    defaults.get is used much like pillar.get except that it will read
    a default value for a pillar from defaults.json or defaults.yaml
    files that are stored in the root of a salt formula.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' defaults.get core:users:root

    The defaults is computed from pillar key. The first entry is considered as
    the formula namespace.

    For example, querying ``core:users:root`` will try to load
    ``salt://core/defaults.yaml`` and ``salt://core/defaults.json``.
    

defaults.merge:

    defaults.merge
        Allows deep merging of dicts in formulas.

    merge_lists : False
        If True, it will also merge lists instead of replace their items.

    in_place : True
        If True, it will merge into dest dict,
        if not it will make a new copy from that dict and return it.

    convert_none : True
        If True, it will convert src and dest to empty dicts if they are None.
        If True and dest is None but in_place is True, raises TypeError.
        If False it will make a new copy from that dict and return it.

        New in version 3005

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' defaults.merge '{a: b}' '{d: e}'

    It is more typical to use this in a templating language in formulas,
    instead of directly on the command-line.
    

defaults.update:

    defaults.update
        Allows setting defaults for group of data set e.g. group for nodes.

        This function is a combination of defaults.merge
        and defaults.deepcopy to avoid redundant in jinja.

        Example:

            group01:
              defaults:
                enabled: True
                extra:
                  - test
                  - stage
              nodes:
                host01:
                  index: foo
                  upstream: bar
                host02:
                  index: foo2
                  upstream: bar2

            {% do salt['defaults.update'](group01.nodes, group01.defaults) %}

        Each node will look like the following:

            host01:
              enabled: True
              index: foo
              upstream: bar
              extra:
                - test
                - stage

    merge_lists : True
        If True, it will also merge lists instead of replace their items.

    in_place : True
        If True, it will merge into dest dict.
        if not it will make a new copy from that dict and return it.

    convert_none : True
        If True, it will convert src and dest to empty dicts if they are None.
        If True and dest is None but in_place is True, raises TypeError.
        If False it will make a new copy from that dict and return it.

        New in version 3005

    It is more typical to use this in a templating language in formulas,
    instead of directly on the command-line.
    

devinfo.filter:

    Returns a list of devices, filtered under udev keys.

    udev_in
        A dictionary of key:values that are expected in the device
        udev information

    udev_ex
        A dictionary of key:values that are not expected in the device
        udev information (excluded)

    The key is a lower case string, joined by dots, that represent a
    path in the udev information dictionary. For example, 'e.id_bus'
    will represent the udev entry `udev['E']['ID_BUS']`

    If the udev entry is a list, the algorithm will check that at
    least one item match one item of the value of the parameters.

    Returns list of devices that match `udev_in` and do not match
    `udev_ex`.

    CLI Example:

       salt '*' devinfo.filter udev_in='{"e.id_bus": "ata"}'

    

devinfo.hwinfo:

    Probe for hardware

    items
        List of hardware items to inspect. Default ['bios', 'cpu', 'disk',
        'memory', 'network', 'partition']

        Show only a summary. Default True.

    listmd
        Report RAID devices. Default False.

    devices
        List of devices to show information from. Default None.

    CLI Example:

       salt '*' devinfo.hwinfo
       salt '*' devinfo.hwinfo items='["disk"]' short=no
       salt '*' devinfo.hwinfo items='["disk"]' short=no devices='["/dev/sda"]'
       salt '*' devinfo.hwinfo devices=/dev/sda

    

devmap.multipath_flush:

    Device-Mapper Multipath flush

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' devmap.multipath_flush mpath1
    

devmap.multipath_list:

    Device-Mapper Multipath list

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' devmap.multipath_list
    

dig.A:

    Return the A record for ``host``.

    Always returns a list.

    CLI Example:

        salt ns1 dig.A www.google.com
    

dig.AAAA:

    Return the AAAA record for ``host``.

    Always returns a list.

    CLI Example:

        salt ns1 dig.AAAA www.google.com
    

dig.CNAME:

    Return the CNAME record for ``host``.

    New in version 3005

    CLI Example:

        salt ns1 dig.CNAME mail.google.com
    

dig.MX:

    Return a list of lists for the MX of ``domain``.

    If the ``resolve`` argument is True, resolve IPs for the servers.

    It's limited to one IP, because although in practice it's very rarely a
    round robin, it is an acceptable configuration and pulling just one IP lets
    the data be similar to the non-resolved version. If you think an MX has
    multiple IPs, don't use the resolver here, resolve them in a separate step.

    CLI Example:

        salt ns1 dig.MX google.com
    

dig.NS:

    Return a list of IPs of the nameservers for ``domain``

    If ``resolve`` is False, don't resolve names.

    CLI Example:

        salt ns1 dig.NS google.com
    

dig.PTR:

    New in version 3006.0

    Return the PTR record for ``host``.

    Always returns a list.

    CLI Example:

        salt ns1 dig.PTR 1.2.3.4
    

dig.SPF:

    Return the allowed IPv4 ranges in the SPF record for ``domain``.

    If record is ``SPF`` and the SPF record is empty, the TXT record will be
    searched automatically. If you know the domain uses TXT and not SPF,
    specifying that will save a lookup.

    CLI Example:

        salt ns1 dig.SPF google.com
    

dig.TXT:

    Return the TXT record for ``host``.

    Always returns a list.

    CLI Example:

        salt ns1 dig.A www.google.com
    

dig.aaaa:

    Return the AAAA record for ``host``.

    Always returns a list.

    CLI Example:

        salt ns1 dig.CNAME mail.google.com
    

dig.mx:

    Return a list of lists for the MX of ``domain``.

    If the ``resolve`` argument is True, resolve IPs for the servers.

    It's limited to one IP, because although in practice it's very rarely a
    round robin, it is an acceptable configuration and pulling just one IP lets
    the data be similar to the non-resolved version. If you think an MX has
    multiple IPs, don't use the resolver here, resolve them in a separate step.

    CLI Example:

        salt ns1 dig.MX google.com
    

dig.ns:

    Return a list of IPs of the nameservers for ``domain``

    If ``resolve`` is False, don't resolve names.

    If record is ``SPF`` and the SPF record is empty, the TXT record will be
    searched automatically. If you know the domain uses TXT and not SPF,
    specifying that will save a lookup.

    CLI Example:

        salt ns1 dig.SPF google.com
    

disk.blkid:

    Return block device attributes: UUID, LABEL, etc. This function only works
    on systems where blkid is available.

    device
        Device name from the system

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' disk.blkid
        salt '*' disk.blkid /dev/sda
        salt '*' disk.blkid token='UUID=6a38ee5-7235-44e7-8b22-816a403bad5d'

    inode_size
        Size of the inodes

        This option is only enabled for ext and xfs filesystems

    lazy_itable_init
        If enabled and the uninit_bg feature is enabled, the inode table will
        not be fully initialized by mke2fs.  This speeds up filesystem
        initialization noticeably, but it requires the kernel to finish
        initializing the filesystem  in  the  background  when  the filesystem
        is first mounted.  If the option value is omitted, it defaults to 1 to
        enable lazy inode table zeroing.

        This option is only enabled for ext filesystems

    fat
        FAT size option. Can be 12, 16 or 32, and can only be used on
        fat or vfat filesystems.

    force
        Force mke2fs to create a filesystem, even if the specified device is
        not a partition on a block special device. This option is only enabled
        for ext and xfs filesystems

    New in version 3000

    settings_module
        Specifies the settings module to use.
        The settings module should be in Python package syntax, e.g. mysite.settings.
        If this isn’t provided, django-admin will use the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
        environment variable.

    app_label
        Specific app to run migrations for, instead of all apps.
        This may involve running other apps’ migrations too, due to dependencies.

    migration_name
        Named migration to be applied to a specific app.
        Brings the database schema to a state where the named migration is applied,
        but no later migrations in the same app are applied. This may involve
        unapplying migrations if you have previously migrated past the named migration.
        Use the name zero to unapply all migrations for an app.

    bin_env
        Path to pip (or to a virtualenv). This can be used to specify the path
        to the pip to use when more than one Python release is installed (e.g.
        ``/usr/bin/pip-2.7`` or ``/usr/bin/pip-2.6``. If a directory path is
        specified, it is assumed to be a virtualenv.

    database
        Database to migrate. Defaults to 'default'.

    pythonpath
        Adds the given filesystem path to the Python import search path.
        If this isn’t provided, django-admin will use the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

    env
        A list of environment variables to be set prior to execution.

        Example:

            module.run:
              - name: django.migrate
              - settings_module: my_django_app.settings
              - env:
                - DATABASE_USER: 'mydbuser'

    noinput
        Suppresses all user prompts. Defaults to True.

    runas
        The user name to run the command as.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' django.migrate <settings_module>
        salt '*' django.migrate <settings_module> <app_label>
        salt '*' django.migrate <settings_module> <app_label> <migration_name>
    

django.syncdb:

    Run syncdb

    Execute the Django-Admin syncdb command, if South is available on the
    minion the ``migrate`` option can be passed as ``True`` calling the
    migrations to run after the syncdb completes

    NOTE: The syncdb command was deprecated in Django 1.7 and removed in Django 1.9.
    For Django versions 1.9 or higher use the `migrate` command instead.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' django.syncdb <settings_module>
    

dnsmasq.fullversion:

    Shows installed version of dnsmasq and compile options.

    CLI Example:

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' dnsmasq.get_config
        salt '*' dnsmasq.get_config config_file=/etc/dnsmasq.conf
    

dnsmasq.set_config:

    Sets a value or a set of values in the specified file. By default, if
    conf-dir is configured in this file, salt will attempt to set the option
    in any file inside the conf-dir where it has already been enabled. If it
    does not find it inside any files, it will append it to the main config
    file. Setting follow to False will turn off this behavior.

    If a config option currently appears multiple times (such as dhcp-host,
    which is specified at least once per host), the new option will be added
    to the end of the main config file (and not to any includes). If you need
    an option added to a specific include file, specify it as the config_file.

    :param string config_file: config file where settings should be updated / added.
    :param bool follow: attempt to set the config option inside any file within
        the ``conf-dir`` where it has already been enabled.
    :param kwargs: key value pairs that contain the configuration settings that you
        want set.

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' dnsmasq.set_config domain=mydomain.com
        salt '*' dnsmasq.set_config follow=False domain=mydomain.com
        salt '*' dnsmasq.set_config config_file=/etc/dnsmasq.conf domain=mydomain.com

dnsutil.MX:

    Return a list of lists for the MX of ``domain``.

    If the 'resolve' argument is True, resolve IPs for the servers.

    It's limited to one IP, because although in practice it's very rarely a
    round robin, it is an acceptable configuration and pulling just one IP lets
    the data be similar to the non-resolved version. If you think an MX has
    multiple IPs, don't use the resolver here, resolve them in a separate step.

    CLI Example:

        salt ns1 dnsutil.MX google.com
    

dnsutil.NS:

dnsutil.SPF:

    Return the allowed IPv4 ranges in the SPF record for ``domain``.

    If record is ``SPF`` and the SPF record is empty, the TXT record will be
    searched automatically. If you know the domain uses TXT and not SPF,
    specifying that will save a lookup.

    CLI Example:

        salt ns1 dnsutil.SPF google.com

dnsutil.hosts_remove:

    Remove a host from the /etc/hosts file. If doing so will leave a line
    containing only an IP address, then the line will be deleted. This function
    will leave comments and blank lines intact.

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' dnsutil.hosts_remove /etc/hosts ad1.yuk.co
        salt '*' dnsutil.hosts_remove /etc/hosts ad2.yuk.co,ad1.yuk.co

dnsutil.serial:

    Return, store and update a dns serial for your zone files.

    zone: a keyword for a specific zone

    update: store an updated version of the serial in a grain

    If ``update`` is False, the function will retrieve an existing serial or
    return the current date if no serial is stored. Nothing will be stored

    If ``update`` is True, the function will set the serial to the current date
    if none exist or if the existing serial is for a previous date. If a serial
    for greater than the current date is already stored, the function will
    increment it.

    This module stores the serial in a grain, you can explicitly set the
    stored value as a grain named ``dnsserial_<zone_name>``.

    CLI Example:

        salt ns1 dnsutil.serial example.com

    environment dictionary. Optionally compare the current value
    of the environment against the supplied value string.

    key
        Must be a string. Used as key for environment lookup.

    value:
        Optional. If key exists in the environment, compare the
        current value with this value. Return True if they are equal.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' environ.has_value foo
    

environ.item:

    Get one or more salt process environment variables.
    Returns a dict.

environ.setenv:

    Set multiple salt process environment variables from a dict.
    Returns a dict.

    environ
        Must be a dict. The top-level keys of the dict are the names
        of the environment variables to set. Each key's value must be
        a string or False. Refer to the 'false_unsets' parameter for
        behavior when a value set to False.

    false_unsets
        If a key's value is False and false_unsets is True, then the
        key will be removed from the salt processes environment dict
        entirely. If a key's value is False and false_unsets is not
        True, then the key's value will be set to an empty string.
        Default: False

    clear_all
        USE WITH CAUTION! This option can unset environment variables
        needed for salt to function properly.
        If clear_all is True, then any environment variables not
        defined in the environ dict will be deleted.
        Default: False

    update_minion
        If True, apply these environ changes to the main salt-minion
        process. If False, the environ changes will only affect the
        current salt subprocess.
        Default: False

    permanent
        On Windows minions this will set the environment variable in the
        registry so that it is always added as an environment variable when
        applications open. If you want to set the variable to HKLM instead of
        HKCU just pass in "HKLM" for this parameter. On all other minion types
        this will be ignored. Note: This will only take affect on applications
        opened after this has been set.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' environ.setenv '{"foo": "bar", "baz": "quux"}'
        salt '*' environ.setenv '{"a": "b", "c": False}' false_unsets=True

    Set a single salt process environment variable. Returns True
    on success.

    key
        The environment key to set. Must be a string.

    val
        The value to set. Must be a string or False. Refer to the
        'false_unsets' parameter for behavior when set to False.

    false_unsets
        If val is False and false_unsets is True, then the key will be
        removed from the salt processes environment dict entirely.
        If val is False and false_unsets is not True, then the key's
        value will be set to an empty string.
        Default: False.

    permanent
        On Windows minions this will set the environment variable in the
        registry so that it is always added as an environment variable when
        applications open. If you want to set the variable to HKLM instead of
        HKCU just pass in "HKLM" for this parameter. On all other minion types
        this will be ignored. Note: This will only take affect on applications
        opened after this has been set.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' environ.setval foo bar
        salt '*' environ.setval baz val=False false_unsets=True

    Fire an event off up to the master server

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' event.fire_master '{"data":"my event data"}' 'tag'
    

event.send:

    Send an event to the Salt Master

    New in version 2014.7.0

    :param tag: A tag to give the event.
        Use slashes to create a namespace for related events. E.g.,
        ``myco/build/buildserver1/start``, ``myco/build/buildserver1/success``,
        ``myco/build/buildserver1/failure``.

    :param data: A dictionary of data to send in the event.
        This is free-form. Send any data points that are needed for whoever is
        consuming the event. Arguments on the CLI are interpreted as YAML so
        complex data structures are possible.

    :param with_env: Include environment variables from the current shell
        environment in the event data as ``environ``.. This is a short-hand for
        working with systems that seed the environment with relevant data such
        as Jenkins.
    :type with_env: Specify ``True`` to include all environment variables, or
        specify a list of strings of variable names to include.

    :param with_grains: Include grains from the current minion in the event
        data as ``grains``.
    :type with_grains: Specify ``True`` to include all grains, or specify a
        list of strings of grain names to include.

    :param with_pillar: Include Pillar values from the current minion in the
        event data as ``pillar``. Remember Pillar data is often sensitive data
        so be careful. This is useful for passing ephemeral Pillar values
        through an event. Such as passing the ``pillar={}`` kwarg in
        :py:func:`state.sls <salt.modules.state.sls>` from the Master, through
        an event on the Minion, then back to the Master.
    :type with_pillar: Specify ``True`` to include all Pillar values, or
        specify a list of strings of Pillar keys to include. It is a
        best-practice to only specify a relevant subset of Pillar data.

    :param with_env_opts: Include ``saltenv`` and ``pillarenv`` set on minion
        at the moment when event is send into event data.
    :type with_env_opts: Specify ``True`` to include ``saltenv`` and
        ``pillarenv`` values or ``False`` to omit them.

    :param kwargs: Any additional keyword arguments passed to this function
        will be interpreted as key-value pairs and included in the event data.
        This provides a convenient alternative to YAML for simple values.

    CLI Example:

        salt-call event.send myco/mytag foo=Foo bar=Bar
        salt-call event.send 'myco/mytag' '{foo: Foo, bar: Bar}'

        the ``module.run`` state.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' extfs.tune /dev/sda1 force=True label=wildstallyns opts='acl,noexec'

                "Salt is what makes things taste bad when it isn't in them."

    .. admonition:: Attention

        If you need to pass a string to append and that string contains
        an equal sign, you **must** include the argument name, args.
        For example:

    New in version 2014.1.0

    Replace content of a text block in a file, delimited by line markers

    A block of content delimited by comments can help you manage several lines
    entries without worrying about old entries removal.

    Note:

        This function will store two copies of the file in-memory (the original
        version and the edited version) in order to detect changes and only
        edit the targeted file if necessary.

    path
        Filesystem path to the file to be edited

    marker_start
        The line content identifying a line as the start of the content block.
        Note that the whole line containing this marker will be considered, so
        whitespace or extra content before or after the marker is included in
        final output

    marker_end
        The line content identifying the end of the content block. As of
        versions 2017.7.5 and 2018.3.1, everything up to the text matching the
        marker will be replaced, so it's important to ensure that your marker
        includes the beginning of the text you wish to replace.

    content
        The content to be used between the two lines identified by marker_start
        and marker_stop.

    append_if_not_found: False
        If markers are not found and set to ``True`` then, the markers and
        content will be appended to the file.

    prepend_if_not_found: False
        If markers are not found and set to ``True`` then, the markers and
        content will be prepended to the file.

    insert_before_match
        If markers are not found, this parameter can be set to a regex which will
        insert the block before the first found occurrence in the file.

        New in version 3001

    insert_after_match
        If markers are not found, this parameter can be set to a regex which will
        insert the block after the first found occurrence in the file.

        New in version 3001

    backup
        The file extension to use for a backup of the file if any edit is made.
        Set to ``False`` to skip making a backup.

        If ``True``, do not make any edits to the file and simply return the
        changes that *would* be made.

    show_changes: True
        Controls how changes are presented. If ``True``, this function will
        return a unified diff of the changes made. If False, then it will
        return a boolean (``True`` if any changes were made, otherwise
        ``False``).

    append_newline: False
        Controls whether or not a newline is appended to the content block. If
        the value of this argument is ``True`` then a newline will be added to
        the content block. If it is ``False``, then a newline will *not* be
        added to the content block. If it is ``None`` then a newline will only
        be added to the content block if it does not already end in a newline.

        New in version 2016.3.4
        Changed in version 2017.7.5,2018.3.1
            New behavior added when value is ``None``.
        Changed in version 2019.2.0
            The default value of this argument will change to ``None`` to match
            the behavior of the :py:func:`file.blockreplace state
            <salt.states.file.blockreplace>`

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.blockreplace /etc/hosts '#-- start managed zone foobar : DO NOT EDIT --' \
        '#-- end managed zone foobar --' $'10.0.1.1 foo.foobar\n10.0.1.2 bar.foobar' True

        Warning:

            This backup will be overwritten each time ``sed`` / ``comment`` /
            ``uncomment`` is called. Meaning the backup will only be useful

        to comment. Can be as simple as ``^color =``

    :param char: string
        The character used to comment a line in the type of file you're referencing.
        Default is ``#``

    :param cmnt: boolean
        True to comment the line. False to uncomment the line. Default is True.

    :param backup: string
        The file extension to give the backup file. Default is ``.bak``
        Set to False/None to not keep a backup.

    :return: boolean
        Returns True if successful, False if not

    CLI Example:

    The following example will comment out the ``pcspkr`` line in the
    ``/etc/modules`` file using the default ``#`` character and create a backup
    file named ``modules.bak``

        salt '*' file.comment_line '/etc/modules' '^pcspkr'

    CLI Example:

    The following example will uncomment the ``log_level`` setting in ``minion``
    config file if it is set to either ``warning``, ``info``, or ``debug`` using
    the ``#`` character and create a backup file named ``minion.bk``

        salt '*' file.comment_line 'C:\salt\conf\minion' '^log_level: (warning|info|debug)' '#' False '.bk'
    

file.contains:

    .. deprecated:: 0.17.0
       Use :func:`search` instead.

    Return ``True`` if the file at ``path`` contains ``text``

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.contains /etc/crontab 'mymaintenance.sh'
    

file.contains_glob:

    .. deprecated:: 0.17.0
       Use :func:`search` instead.

    Return ``True`` if the given glob matches a string in the named file

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.contains_glob /etc/foobar '*cheese*'
    

file.contains_regex:

    .. deprecated:: 0.17.0
       Use :func:`search` instead.

    Return True if the given regular expression matches on any line in the text
    of a given file.

    If the lchar argument (leading char) is specified, it
    will strip `lchar` from the left side of each line before trying to match

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.contains_regex /etc/crontab
    

file.copy:

    Copy a file or directory from source to dst

    In order to copy a directory, the recurse flag is required, and
    will by default overwrite files in the destination with the same path,
    and retain all other existing files. (similar to cp -r on unix)

    remove_existing will remove all files in the target directory,
    and then copy files from the source.

    Note:
        The copy function accepts paths that are local to the Salt minion.
        This function does not support salt://, http://, or the other
        additional file paths that are supported by :mod:`states.file.managed
        <salt.states.file.managed>` and :mod:`states.file.recurse
        <salt.states.file.recurse>`.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.copy /path/to/src /path/to/dst
        salt '*' file.copy /path/to/src_dir /path/to/dst_dir recurse=True
        salt '*' file.copy /path/to/src_dir /path/to/dst_dir recurse=True remove_existing=True

    

file.delete_backup:

    New in version 0.17.0

    :ref:`file state backup <file-state-backups>` system.

    path
        The path on the minion to check for backups
    backup_id
        The numeric id for the backup you wish to delete, as found using
        :mod:`file.list_backups <salt.modules.file.list_backups>`

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.delete_backup /var/cache/salt/minion/file_backup/home/foo/bar/baz.txt 0
    

file.directory_exists:

    Tests to see if path is a valid directory.  Returns True/False.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.directory_exists /etc

    

file.dirname:

    Returns the directory component of a pathname

    New in version 2015.5.0

    This can be useful at the CLI but is frequently useful when scripting.

        {%- from salt['file.dirname'](tpldir) + '/vars.jinja' import parent_vars %}

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.dirname 'test/path/filename.config'
    

file.diskusage:

    Recursively calculate disk usage of path and return it
    in bytes

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.diskusage /path/to/check
    

file.extract_hash:

    Changed in version 2016.3.5
        Prior to this version, only the ``file_name`` argument was considered
        for filename matches in the hash file. This would be problematic for
        cases in which the user was relying on a remote checksum file that they
        do not control, and they wished to use a different name for that file
        on the minion from the filename on the remote server (and in the
        checksum file). For example, managing ``/tmp/myfile.tar.gz`` when the
        remote file was at ``https://mydomain.tld/different_name.tar.gz``. The
        :py:func:`file.managed <salt.states.file.managed>` state now also
        passes this function the source URI as well as the ``source_hash_name``
        (if specified). In cases where ``source_hash_name`` is specified, it
        takes precedence over both the ``file_name`` and ``source``. When it is
        not specified, ``file_name`` takes precedence over ``source``. This
        allows for better capability for matching hashes.
    Changed in version 2016.11.0
        File name and source URI matches are no longer disregarded when
        ``source_hash_name`` is specified. They will be used as fallback
        matches if there is no match to the ``source_hash_name`` value.

    This routine is called from the :mod:`file.managed
    <salt.states.file.managed>` state to pull a hash from a remote file.
    Regular expressions are used line by line on the ``source_hash`` file, to
    find a potential candidate of the indicated hash type. This avoids many
    problems of arbitrary file layout rules. It specifically permits pulling
    hash codes from debian ``*.dsc`` files.

    If no exact match of a hash and filename are found, then the first hash
    found (if any) will be returned. If no hashes at all are found, then
    ``None`` will be returned.

    For example:

        openerp_7.0-latest-1.tar.gz:
          file.managed:
            - name: /tmp/openerp_7.0-20121227-075624-1_all.deb
            - source: http://nightly.openerp.com/7.0/nightly/deb/openerp_7.0-20121227-075624-1.tar.gz
            - source_hash: http://nightly.openerp.com/7.0/nightly/deb/openerp_7.0-20121227-075624-1.dsc

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.extract_hash /path/to/hash/file sha512 /etc/foo
    

file.file_exists:

    Tests to see if path is a valid file.  Returns True/False.

        mtime   = interval                  # modified since date
        grep    = regex                     # search file contents

    and/or actions:

        delete [= file-types]               # default type = 'f'
        exec    = command [arg ...]         # where {} is replaced by pathname
        print  [= print-opts]

    and/or depth criteria:

        maxdepth = maximum depth to transverse in path

    The default action is ``print=path``

    ``path-glob``:

        *                = match zero or more chars
        ?                = match any char
        [abc]            = match a, b, or c
        [!abc] or [^abc] = match anything except a, b, and c
        [x-y]            = match chars x through y
        [!x-y] or [^x-y] = match anything except chars x through y

file.get_diff:

    Return unified diff of two files

    file1
        The first file to feed into the diff utility

        Changed in version 2018.3.0
            Can now be either a local or remote file. In earlier releases,
            thuis had to be a file local to the minion.

    file2
        The second file to feed into the diff utility

        Changed in version 2018.3.0
            Can now be either a local or remote file. In earlier releases, this
            had to be a file on the salt fileserver (i.e.
            ``salt://somefile.txt``)

    show_filenames: True
        Set to ``False`` to hide the filenames in the top two lines of the
        diff.

    show_changes: True
        If set to ``False``, and there are differences, then instead of a diff
        a simple message stating that show_changes is set to ``False`` will be
        returned.

    template: False
        Set to ``True`` if two templates are being compared. This is not useful
        except for within states, with the ``obfuscate_templates`` option set
        to ``True``.

        New in version 2018.3.0

    source_hash_file1
        If ``file1`` is an http(s)/ftp URL and the file exists in the minion's
        file cache, this option can be passed to keep the minion from
        re-downloading the archive if the cached copy matches the specified
        hash.

        New in version 2018.3.0

    source_hash_file2
        If ``file2`` is an http(s)/ftp URL and the file exists in the minion's
        file cache, this option can be passed to keep the minion from
        re-downloading the archive if the cached copy matches the specified
        hash.

        New in version 2018.3.0

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' file.get_diff /home/fred/.vimrc salt://users/fred/.vimrc
        salt '*' file.get_diff /tmp/foo.txt /tmp/bar.txt
    

file.get_gid:

    Return the id of the group that owns a given file

    path
        file or directory of which to get the gid

    follow_symlinks
        indicated if symlinks should be followed

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.get_gid /etc/passwd

    Changed in version 0.16.4
        ``follow_symlinks`` option added
    

file.get_group:

    Return the group that owns a given file

    path
        file or directory of which to get the group

    follow_symlinks
        indicated if symlinks should be followed

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.get_group /etc/passwd

    Changed in version 0.16.4
        ``follow_symlinks`` option added
    

file.get_hash:

    Get the hash sum of a file

    This is better than ``get_sum`` for the following reasons:
        - It does not read the entire file into memory.
        - It does not return a string on error. The returned value of
            ``get_sum`` cannot really be trusted since it is vulnerable to
            collisions: ``get_sum(..., 'xyz') == 'Hash xyz not supported'``

    path
        path to the file or directory

    form
        desired sum format

    chunk_size
        amount to sum at once

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.get_hash /etc/shadow
    

file.get_managed:

    Return the managed file data for file.managed

    name
        location where the file lives on the server

    source_hash
        hash of the source file

    source_hash_name
        When ``source_hash`` refers to a remote file, this specifies the
        filename to look for in that file.

        New in version 2016.3.5

    user
        Owner of file

    group
        Group owner of file

    mode
        Permissions of file

    attrs
        Attributes of file

        New in version 2018.3.0

    context
        Variables to add to the template context

    defaults
        Default values of for context_dict

    skip_verify
        If ``True``, hash verification of remote file sources (``http://``,
        ``https://``, ``ftp://``) will be skipped, and the ``source_hash``
        argument will be ignored.

        New in version 2016.3.0

    verify_ssl
        If ``False``, remote https file sources (``https://``) and source_hash
        will not attempt to validate the servers certificate. Default is True.

        New in version 3002

    use_etag
        If ``True``, remote http/https file sources will attempt to use the
        ETag header to determine if the remote file needs to be downloaded.
        This provides a lightweight mechanism for promptly refreshing files
        changed on a web server without requiring a full hash comparison via
        the ``source_hash`` parameter.

        New in version 3005

    source_hash_sig
        When ``source`` is a remote file source, ``source_hash`` is a file,
        ``skip_verify`` is not true and ``use_etag`` is not true, ensure a
        valid GPG signature exists on the source hash file.
        Set this to ``true`` for an inline (clearsigned) signature, or to a
        file URI retrievable by `:py:func:`cp.cache_file <salt.modules.cp.cache_file>`
        for a detached one.

        New in version 3007.0

    signed_by_any
        When verifying ``source_hash_sig``, require at least one valid signature
        from one of a list of key fingerprints. This is passed to :py:func:`gpg.verify

        New in version 3007.0

    signed_by_all
        When verifying ``source_hash_sig``, require a valid signature from each
        of the key fingerprints in this list. This is passed to :py:func:`gpg.verify
        <salt.modules.gpg.verify>`.

file.get_mode:

    Return the mode of a file

    path
        file or directory of which to get the mode

    follow_symlinks
        indicated if symlinks should be followed

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.get_mode /etc/passwd

    Changed in version 2014.1.0
        ``follow_symlinks`` option added

    obtain the hash and hash type from the parameters specified below.

    file_name
        Optional file name being managed, for matching with
        :py:func:`file.extract_hash <salt.modules.file.extract_hash>`.

    source
        Source file, as used in :py:mod:`file <salt.states.file>` and other
        states. If ``source_hash`` refers to a file containing hashes, then
        this filename will be used to match a filename in that file. If the
        ``source_hash`` is a hash expression, then this argument will be
        ignored.

    source_hash
        Hash file/expression, as used in :py:mod:`file <salt.states.file>` and
        other states. If this value refers to a remote URL or absolute path to
        a local file, it will be cached and :py:func:`file.extract_hash
        <salt.modules.file.extract_hash>` will be used to obtain a hash from
        it.

    source_hash_name
        Specific file name to look for when ``source_hash`` refers to a remote
        file, used to disambiguate ambiguous matches.

    saltenv: base
        Salt fileserver environment from which to retrieve the source_hash. This
        value will only be used when ``source_hash`` refers to a file on the
        Salt fileserver (i.e. one beginning with ``salt://``).

    verify_ssl
        If ``False``, remote https file sources (``https://``) and source_hash
        will not attempt to validate the servers certificate. Default is True.

        New in version 3002

            is being used then the path should be quoted to keep the shell from
            attempting to expand the glob expression.

    pattern
        Pattern to match. For example: ``test``, or ``a[0-5]``

    opts
        Additional command-line flags to pass to the grep command. For example:
        ``-v``, or ``-i -B2``

        Note:
            The options should come after a double-dash (as shown in the
            examples below) to keep Salt's own argument parser from
            interpreting them.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.grep /etc/passwd nobody
        salt '*' file.grep /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 ipaddr -- -i
        salt '*' file.grep /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 ipaddr -- -i -B2
        salt '*' file.grep "/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/*" ipaddr -- -i -l
    

file.group_to_gid:

    Convert the group to the gid on this system

    group
        group to convert to its gid

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.group_to_gid root
    

file.is_blkdev:

    Check if a file exists and is a block device.

    CLI Example:

       salt '*' file.is_blkdev /dev/blk
    

file.is_chrdev:

    Check if a file exists and is a character device.

    CLI Example:

       salt '*' file.is_chrdev /dev/chr
    

file.is_fifo:

    Check if a file exists and is a FIFO.

    CLI Example:

       salt '*' file.is_fifo /dev/fifo
    

file.is_hardlink:

    Check if the path is a hard link by verifying that the number of links
    is larger than 1

    CLI Example:

       salt '*' file.is_hardlink /path/to/link
    

file.is_link:

    Check if the path is a symbolic link

    CLI Example:

       salt '*' file.is_link /path/to/link
    

file.join:

    Return a normalized file system path for the underlying OS

    New in version 2014.7.0

    This can be useful at the CLI but is frequently useful when scripting
    combining path variables:

        {% set www_root = '/var' %}
        {% set app_dir = 'myapp' %}

        myapp_config:
          file:
            - managed
            - name: {{ salt['file.join'](www_root, app_dir, 'config.yaml') }}

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.join '/' 'usr' 'local' 'bin'
    

file.lchown:

    symlinks.

    path
        path to the file or directory

    user
        user owner

    group
        group owner

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.chown /etc/passwd root root
    

file.line:

    New in version 2015.8.0

    Line-focused editing of a file.

    Note:

        ``file.line`` exists for historic reasons, and is not
        generally recommended. It has a lot of quirks.  You may find
        ``file.replace`` to be more suitable.

    ``file.line`` is most useful if you have single lines in a file
    (potentially a config file) that you would like to manage. It can
    remove, add, and replace a single line at a time.

    path
        Filesystem path to the file to be edited.

    content
        Content of the line. Allowed to be empty if ``mode='delete'``.

    match
        Match the target line for an action by
        a fragment of a string or regular expression.

        If neither ``before`` nor ``after`` are provided, and ``match``
        is also ``None``, match falls back to the ``content`` value.

    mode
        Defines how to edit a line. One of the following options is
        required:

        - ensure
            If line does not exist, it will be added. If ``before``
            and ``after`` are specified either zero lines, or lines
            that contain the ``content`` line are allowed to be in between
            ``before`` and ``after``. If there are lines, and none of
            them match then it will produce an error.
        - replace
            If line already exists, the entire line will be replaced.
        - delete
            Delete the line, if found.
        - insert
            Nearly identical to ``ensure``. If a line does not exist,
            it will be added.

            The differences are that multiple (and non-matching) lines are
            alloweed between ``before`` and ``after``, if they are
            specified. The line will always be inserted right before
            ``before``. ``insert`` also allows the use of ``location`` to
            specify that the line should be added at the beginning or end of
            the file.

        Note:

            If ``mode='insert'`` is used, at least one of ``location``,
            ``before``, or ``after`` is required.  If ``location`` is used,
            ``before`` and ``after`` are ignored.

    location
        In ``mode='insert'`` only, whether to place the ``content`` at the
        beginning or end of a the file. If ``location`` is provided,
        ``before`` and ``after`` are ignored. Valid locations:

        - start
            Place the content at the beginning of the file.
        - end
            Place the content at the end of the file.

    before
        Regular expression or an exact case-sensitive fragment of the string.
        Will be tried as **both** a regex **and** a part of the line.  Must
        match **exactly** one line in the file.  This value is only used in
        ``ensure`` and ``insert`` modes. The ``content`` will be inserted just
        before this line, with matching indentation unless ``indent=False``.

    after
        Regular expression or an exact case-sensitive fragment of the string.
        Will be tried as **both** a regex **and** a part of the line.  Must
        match **exactly** one line in the file.  This value is only used in
        ``ensure`` and ``insert`` modes. The ``content`` will be inserted
        directly after this line, unless ``before`` is also provided. If
        ``before`` is not provided, indentation will match this line, unless
        ``indent=False``.

    show_changes
        Output a unified diff of the old file and the new file.
        If ``False`` return a boolean if any changes were made.
        Default is ``True``

        Note:
            Using this option will store two copies of the file in-memory
            (the original version and the edited version) in order to generate the diff.

    backup
        Create a backup of the original file with the extension:
        "Year-Month-Day-Hour-Minutes-Seconds".

    quiet
        Do not raise any exceptions. E.g. ignore the fact that the file that is
        tried to be edited does not exist and nothing really happened.

    indent
        Keep indentation with the previous line. This option is not considered when
        the ``delete`` mode is specified. Default is ``True``

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.line /etc/nsswitch.conf "networks: files dns" after="hosts:.*?" mode='ensure'

    Note:

        If an equal sign (``=``) appears in an argument to a Salt command, it is
        interpreted as a keyword argument in the format of ``key=val``. That
        processing can be bypassed in order to pass an equal sign through to the
        remote shell command by manually specifying the kwarg:

            salt '*' file.line /path/to/file content="CREATEMAIL_SPOOL=no" match="CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=yes" mode="replace"

    **Examples:**

    Here's a simple config file.

        [some_config]
        # Some config file
        # this line will go away

        here=False
        away=True
        goodybe=away

        salt \* file.line /some/file.conf mode=delete match=away

    This will produce:

        [some_config]
        # Some config file

        here=False
        away=True
        goodbye=away

    If that command is executed 2 more times, this will be the result:

        [some_config]
        # Some config file

        here=False

    If we reset the file to its original state and run

        salt \* file.line /some/file.conf mode=replace match=away content=here

    Three passes will this state will result in this file:

        [some_config]
        # Some config file
        here

        here=False
        here
        here

    Each pass replacing the first line found.

    Given this file:

        insert after me
        something
        insert before me

    The following command

        salt \* file.line /some/file.txt mode=insert after="insert after me" before="insert before me" content=thrice

    If that command is executed 3 times, the result will be:

        insert after me
        something
        thrice
        thrice
        thrice
        insert before me

    If the mode is ``ensure`` instead, it will fail each time. To succeed, we
    need to remove the incorrect line between before and after:

        insert after me
        insert before me

    With an ensure mode, this will insert ``thrice`` the first time and
    make no changes for subsequent calls. For something simple this is
    fine, but if you have instead blocks like this:

        Begin SomeBlock
            foo = bar
        End

        Begin AnotherBlock
            another = value
        End

    And you try to use ensure this way:

        salt \* file.line  /tmp/fun.txt mode="ensure" content="this = should be my content" after="Begin SomeBlock" before="End"

    This will fail because there are multiple ``End`` lines. Without that
    problem, it still would fail because there is a non-matching line,
    ``foo = bar``. Ensure **only** allows either zero, or the matching
    line present to be present in between ``before`` and ``after``.
    

file.link:

    New in version 2014.1.0

    Create a hard link to a file

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.link /path/to/file /path/to/link
    

file.list_backup:

This function is an alias of ``list_backups``.

    New in version 0.17.0

    Lists the previous versions of a file backed up using Salt's :ref:`file
    state backup <file-state-backups>` system.

    path
        The path on the minion to check for backups
    limit
        Limit the number of results to the most recent N backups

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.list_backups /foo/bar/baz.txt
    

file.list_backups:

    New in version 0.17.0

    Lists the previous versions of a file backed up using Salt's :ref:`file
    state backup <file-state-backups>` system.

    path
        The path on the minion to check for backups
    limit
        Limit the number of results to the most recent N backups

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.list_backups /foo/bar/baz.txt
    

file.list_backups_dir:

    Lists the previous versions of a directory backed up using Salt's :ref:`file
    state backup <file-state-backups>` system.

    path
        The directory on the minion to check for backups
    limit
        Limit the number of results to the most recent N backups

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.list_backups_dir /foo/bar/baz/
    

file.lsattr:

    New in version 2018.3.0
    Changed in version 2018.3.1
        If ``lsattr`` is not installed on the system, ``None`` is returned.
    Changed in version 2018.3.4
        If on ``AIX``, ``None`` is returned even if in filesystem as lsattr on ``AIX``
        is not the same thing as the linux version.

    Obtain the modifiable attributes of the given file. If path
    is to a directory, an empty list is returned.

    path
        path to file to obtain attributes of. File/directory must exist.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.lsattr foo1.txt
    

file.lstat:

    New in version 2014.1.0

    Returns the lstat attributes for the given file or dir. Does not support
    symbolic links.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.lstat /path/to/file
    

file.makedirs:

    Ensure that the directory containing this path is available.

    Note:

        The path must end with a trailing slash otherwise the directory/directories
        will be created up to the parent directory. For example if path is
        ``/opt/code``, then it would be treated as ``/opt/`` but if the path
        ends with a trailing slash like ``/opt/code/``, then it would be
        treated as ``/opt/code/``.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.makedirs /opt/code/
    

file.makedirs_perms:

    Taken and modified from os.makedirs to set user, group and mode for each
    directory created.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.makedirs_perms /opt/code
    

file.manage_file:

    Checks the destination against what was retrieved with get_managed and
    makes the appropriate modifications (if necessary).

    name
        location to place the file

    sfn
        location of cached file on the minion

        This is the path to the file stored on the minion. This file is placed
        on the minion using cp.cache_file.  If the hash sum of that file
        matches the source_sum, we do not transfer the file to the minion
        again.

        This file is then grabbed and if it has template set, it renders the
        file to be placed into the correct place on the system using
        salt.files.utils.copyfile()

    ret
        The initial state return data structure. Pass in ``None`` to use the
        default structure.

    source
        file reference on the master

    source_sum
        sum hash for source

    user
        user owner

    group
        group owner

    backup
        backup_mode

    attrs
        attributes to be set on file: '' means remove all of them

        New in version 2018.3.0

    makedirs
        make directories if they do not exist

    template
        format of templating

    show_changes
        Include diff in state return

    contents:
        contents to be placed in the file

    dir_mode
        mode for directories created with makedirs

    skip_verify: False
        If ``True``, hash verification of remote file sources (``http://``,
        ``https://``, ``ftp://``) will be skipped, and the ``source_hash``
        argument will be ignored.

        New in version 2016.3.0

    keep_mode: False
        If ``True``, and the ``source`` is a file from the Salt fileserver (or
        a local file on the minion), the mode of the destination file will be
        set to the mode of the source file.

        Note: keep_mode does not work with salt-ssh.

            As a consequence of how the files are transferred to the minion, and
            the inability to connect back to the master with salt-ssh, salt is
            unable to stat the file as it exists on the fileserver and thus
            cannot mirror the mode on the salt-ssh minion

    encoding
        If specified, then the specified encoding will be used. Otherwise, the
        file will be encoded using the system locale (usually UTF-8). See
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings for
        the list of available encodings.

        New in version 2017.7.0

    encoding_errors: 'strict'
        Default is ```'strict'```.
        See https://docs.python.org/2/library/codecs.html#codec-base-classes
        for the error handling schemes.

        New in version 2017.7.0

    seuser
        selinux user attribute

        New in version 3001

    serange
        selinux range attribute

        New in version 3001

    setype
        selinux type attribute

        New in version 3001

    serange
        selinux range attribute

        New in version 3001

    verify_ssl
        If ``False``, remote https file sources (``https://``)
        will not attempt to validate the servers certificate. Default is True.

        New in version 3002

    use_etag
        If ``True``, remote http/https file sources will attempt to use the
        ETag header to determine if the remote file needs to be downloaded.
        This provides a lightweight mechanism for promptly refreshing files
        changed on a web server without requiring a full hash comparison via
        the ``source_hash`` parameter.

        New in version 3005

    signature
        Ensure a valid GPG signature exists on the selected ``source`` file.
        Set this to true for inline signatures, or to a file URI retrievable
        by `:py:func:`cp.cache_file <salt.modules.cp.cache_file>`
        for a detached one.

        Note:

            A signature is only enforced directly after caching the file,
            before it is moved to its final destination. Existing target files
            (with the correct checksum) will neither be checked nor deleted.

            It will be enforced regardless of source type and will be
            required on the final output, therefore this does not lend itself
            well when templates are rendered.
            The file will not be modified, meaning inline signatures are not
            removed.

        New in version 3007.0

    source_hash_sig
        When ``source`` is a remote file source, ``source_hash`` is a file,
        ``skip_verify`` is not true and ``use_etag`` is not true, ensure a
        valid GPG signature exists on the source hash file.
        Set this to ``true`` for an inline (clearsigned) signature, or to a
        file URI retrievable by `:py:func:`cp.cache_file <salt.modules.cp.cache_file>`
        for a detached one.

        Note:

            A signature on the ``source_hash`` file is enforced regardless of
            changes since its contents are used to check if an existing file
            is in the correct state - but only for remote sources!
            As for ``signature``, existing target files will not be modified,
            only the cached source_hash and source_hash_sig files will be removed.

        New in version 3007.0

    signed_by_any
        When verifying signatures either on the managed file or its source hash file,
        require at least one valid signature from one of a list of key fingerprints.
        This is passed to :py:func:`gpg.verify <salt.modules.gpg.verify>`.

        New in version 3007.0

    signed_by_all
        When verifying signatures either on the managed file or its source hash file,
        require a valid signature from each of the key fingerprints in this list.
        This is passed to :py:func:`gpg.verify <salt.modules.gpg.verify>`.

        New in version 3007.0

    keyring
        When verifying signatures, use this keyring.

        New in version 3007.0

    gnupghome
        When verifying signatures, use this GnuPG home.

        New in version 3007.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.manage_file /etc/httpd/conf.d/httpd.conf '' '{}' salt://http/httpd.conf '{hash_type: 'md5', 'hsum': <md5sum>}' root root '755' '' base ''

    Changed in version 2014.7.0
        ``follow_symlinks`` option added

    

file.mkdir:

    Ensure that a directory is available.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.mkdir /opt/jetty/context
    

file.mknod:

    New in version 0.17.0

    Create a block device, character device, or fifo pipe.
    Identical to the gnu mknod.

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' file.mknod /dev/chr c 180 31
        salt '*' file.mknod /dev/blk b 8 999
        salt '*' file.nknod /dev/fifo p
    

file.mknod_blkdev:

    New in version 0.17.0

       salt '*' file.mknod_blkdev /dev/blk 8 999
    

file.mknod_chrdev:

    New in version 0.17.0

    Create a character device.

    CLI Example:

       salt '*' file.mknod_chrdev /dev/chr 180 31
    

file.mknod_fifo:

    New in version 0.17.0

    Create a FIFO pipe.

    CLI Example:

       salt '*' file.mknod_fifo /dev/fifo
    

file.move:

    Move a file or directory

    disallow_copy_and_unlink
        If ``True``, the operation is offloaded to the ``file.rename`` execution
        module function. This will use ``os.rename`` underneath, which will fail
        in the event that ``src`` and ``dst`` are on different filesystems. If
        ``False`` (the default), ``shutil.move`` will be used in order to fall
        back on a "copy then unlink" approach, which is required for moving
        across filesystems.

        New in version 3006.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.move /path/to/src /path/to/dst
    

file.normpath:

    Returns Normalize path, eliminating double slashes, etc.

    New in version 2015.5.0

    This can be useful at the CLI but is frequently useful when scripting.

        {%- from salt['file.normpath'](tpldir + '/../vars.jinja') import parent_vars %}

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.normpath 'a/b/c/..'
    

file.open_files:

    Return a list of all physical open files on the system.

    .. admonition:: Attention

        If you need to pass a string to append and that string contains
        an equal sign, you **must** include the argument name, args.
        For example:

            salt '*' file.prepend /etc/motd args='cheese=spam'

            salt '*' file.prepend /etc/motd args="['cheese=spam','spam=cheese']"

    after
        Text that will replace ``before``
    limit: ``''``
        An initial pattern to search for before searching for ``before``

          - ``M``: Treat multiple lines as a single line.
          - ``S``: Make `.` match all characters, including newlines.
          - ``U``: Make ``\w``, ``\W``, ``\b``, ``\B``, ``\d``, ``\D``,
            ``\s`` and ``\S`` dependent on Unicode.

    Forward slashes and single quotes will be escaped automatically in the
    ``before`` and ``after`` patterns.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.sed /etc/httpd/httpd.conf 'LogLevel warn' 'LogLevel info'
    

file.read:

    New in version 2017.7.0

    Return the content of the file.

    :param bool binary:
        Whether to read and return binary data

    CLI Example:

file.readdir:

    New in version 2014.1.0

    Return a list containing the contents of a directory

    CLI Example:

file.readlink:

    New in version 2014.1.0

    Return the path that a symlink points to

    Args:

        path (str):
            The path to the symlink

        canonicalize (bool):
            Get the canonical path eliminating any symbolic links encountered in
            the path

    Returns:

        str: The path that the symlink points to

    Raises:

        SaltInvocationError: path is not absolute

        SaltInvocationError: path is not a link

        CommandExecutionError: error reading the symbolic link

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.readlink /path/to/link

file.remove_backup:

This function is an alias of ``delete_backup``.

    New in version 0.17.0

    Delete a previous version of a file that was backed up using Salt's
    :ref:`file state backup <file-state-backups>` system.

    path
        The path on the minion to check for backups
    backup_id
        The numeric id for the backup you wish to delete, as found using
        :mod:`file.list_backups <salt.modules.file.list_backups>`

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.delete_backup /var/cache/salt/minion/file_backup/home/foo/bar/baz.txt 0
    

file.rename:

    Rename a file or directory

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.rename /path/to/src /path/to/dst
    

file.replace:

    New in version 0.17.0

    Replace occurrences of a pattern in a file. If ``show_changes`` is
    ``True``, then a diff of what changed will be returned, otherwise a
    ``True`` will be returned when changes are made, and ``False`` when
    no changes are made.

    This is a pure Python implementation that wraps Python's :py:func:`~re.sub`.

    path
        Filesystem path to the file to be edited. If a symlink is specified, it
        will be resolved to its target.

    pattern
        A regular expression, to be matched using Python's
        :py:func:`~re.search`.

    repl
        The replacement text

    count: 0
        Maximum number of pattern occurrences to be replaced. If count is a
        positive integer ``n``, only ``n`` occurrences will be replaced,
        otherwise all occurrences will be replaced.

    flags (list or int)
        A list of flags defined in the ``re`` module documentation from the
        Python standard library. Each list item should be a string that will
        correlate to the human-friendly flag name. E.g., ``['IGNORECASE',
        'MULTILINE']``. Optionally, ``flags`` may be an int, with a value
        corresponding to the XOR (``|``) of all the desired flags. Defaults to
        8 (which supports 'MULTILINE').

    bufsize (int or str)
        How much of the file to buffer into memory at once. The
        default value ``1`` processes one line at a time. The special value
        ``file`` may be specified which will read the entire file into memory
        before processing.

    append_if_not_found: False
        New in version 2014.7.0

        If set to ``True``, and pattern is not found, then the content will be
        appended to the file.

    prepend_if_not_found: False
        New in version 2014.7.0

        If set to ``True`` and pattern is not found, then the content will be
        prepended to the file.

    not_found_content
        New in version 2014.7.0

        Content to use for append/prepend if not found. If None (default), uses
        ``repl``. Useful when ``repl`` uses references to group in pattern.

    backup: .bak
        The file extension to use for a backup of the file before editing. Set
        to ``False`` to skip making a backup.

    dry_run: False
        If set to ``True``, no changes will be made to the file, the function
        will just return the changes that would have been made (or a
        ``True``/``False`` value if ``show_changes`` is set to ``False``).

    search_only: False
        If set to true, this no changes will be performed on the file, and this
        function will simply return ``True`` if the pattern was matched, and
        ``False`` if not.

    show_changes: True
        If ``True``, return a diff of changes made. Otherwise, return ``True``
        if changes were made, and ``False`` if not.

        Note:
            Using this option will store two copies of the file in memory (the
            original version and the edited version) in order to generate the
            diff. This may not normally be a concern, but could impact
            performance if used with large files.

    ignore_if_missing: False
        New in version 2015.8.0

        If set to ``True``, this function will simply return ``False``
        if the file doesn't exist. Otherwise, an error will be thrown.

    preserve_inode: True
        New in version 2015.8.0

        Preserve the inode of the file, so that any hard links continue to
        share the inode with the original filename. This works by *copying* the
        file, reading from the copy, and writing to the file at the original
        inode. If ``False``, the file will be *moved* rather than copied, and a
        new file will be written to a new inode, but using the original
        filename. Hard links will then share an inode with the backup, instead
        (if using ``backup`` to create a backup copy).

    backslash_literal: False
        New in version 2016.11.7

        Interpret backslashes as literal backslashes for the repl and not
        escape characters.  This will help when using append/prepend so that
        the backslashes are not interpreted for the repl on the second run of
        the state.

    If an equal sign (``=``) appears in an argument to a Salt command it is
    interpreted as a keyword argument in the format ``key=val``. That
    processing can be bypassed in order to pass an equal sign through to the
    remote shell command by manually specifying the kwarg:

        salt '*' file.replace /path/to/file pattern='=' repl=':'
        salt '*' file.replace /path/to/file pattern="bind-address\s*=" repl='bind-address:'

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' file.replace /etc/httpd/httpd.conf pattern='LogLevel warn' repl='LogLevel info'
        salt '*' file.replace /some/file pattern='before' repl='after' flags='[MULTILINE, IGNORECASE]'
    

file.restore_backup:

    New in version 0.17.0

    :ref:`file state backup <file-state-backups>` system.

    path
        The path on the minion to check for backups
    backup_id
        The numeric id for the backup you wish to restore, as found using
        :mod:`file.list_backups <salt.modules.file.list_backups>`

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.restore_backup /foo/bar/baz.txt 0

    Remove the specified directory. Fails if a directory is not empty.

    recurse
        When ``recurse`` is set to ``True``, all empty directories
        within the path are pruned.

        New in version 3006.0

    verbose
        When ``verbose`` is set to ``True``, a dictionary is returned
        which contains more information about the removal process.

        New in version 3006.0

    older_than
        When ``older_than`` is set to a number, it is used to determine the
        **number of days** which must have passed since the last modification
        timestamp before a directory will be allowed to be removed. Setting
        the value to 0 is equivalent to leaving it at the default of ``None``.

        New in version 3006.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' file.rmdir /tmp/foo/
    

file.search:

        salt '*' freezer.freeze
        salt '*' freezer.freeze pre_install
        salt '*' freezer.freeze force=True root=/chroot

    

freezer.list:

    Return the list of frozen states.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' freezer.list

    

freezer.restore:

    Make sure that the system contains the packages and repos from a
    frozen state.

    Read the list of packages and repositories from the freeze file,
    and compare it with the current list of packages and repos. If
    there is any difference, all the missing packages are repos will
    be installed, and all the extra packages and repos will be
    removed.

    As this module is build on top of the pkg module, the user can
    send extra attributes to the underlying pkg module via kwargs.
    This function will call ``pkg.list_repos``, ``pkg.mod_repo``,
    ``pkg.list_pkgs``, ``pkg.install``, ``pkg.remove`` and
    ``pkg.del_repo``, and any additional arguments will be passed
    through to those functions.

    name
        Name of the frozen state. Optional.

    clean
        If True remove the frozen information YAML from the cache

        New in version 3000

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' freezer.restore
        salt '*' freezer.restore root=/chroot

    

freezer.status:

    Return True if there is already a frozen state.

    A frozen state is merely a list of packages (including the
    version) in a specific time. This information can be used to
    compare with the current list of packages, and revert the
    installation of some extra packages that are in the system.

    name
        Name of the frozen state. Optional.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' freezer.status
        salt '*' freezer.status pre_install

genesis.avail_platforms:

    Return which platforms are available

    CLI Example:

        salt myminion genesis.avail_platforms
    

genesis.bootstrap:

    Create an image for a specific platform.

    Please note that this function *MUST* be run as root, as images that are
    created make files belonging to root.

    platform
        Which platform to use to create the image. Currently supported platforms
        are rpm, deb and pacman.

    root
        Local path to create the root of the image filesystem.

    img_format
        Which format to create the image in. By default, just copies files into
        a directory on the local filesystem (``dir``). Future support will exist
        for ``sparse``.

    fs_format
        When using a non-``dir`` ``img_format``, which filesystem to format the
        image to. By default, ``ext2``.

    fs_opts
        When using a non-``dir`` ``img_format``, a dict of opts may be
        specified.

    arch
        Architecture to install packages for, if supported by the underlying
        bootstrap tool. Currently only used for deb.

    flavor
        Which flavor of operating system to install. This correlates to a
        specific directory on the distribution repositories. For instance,
        ``wheezy`` on Debian.

    repo_url
        Mainly important for Debian-based repos. Base URL for the mirror to
        install from. (e.x.: http://ftp.debian.org/debian/)

    static_qemu
        Local path to the static qemu binary required for this arch.
        (e.x.: /usr/bin/qemu-amd64-static)

    pkg_confs
        The location of the conf files to copy into the image, to point the
        installer to the right repos and configuration.

    img_size
        If img_format is not ``dir``, then the size of the image must be
        specified.

    mount_dir
        If img_format is not ``dir``, then the image must be mounted somewhere.
        If the ``mount_dir`` is not specified, then it will be created at
        ``/opt/salt-genesis.<random_uuid>``. This directory will be unmounted
        and removed when the process is finished.

    pkg_cache
        This points to a directory containing a cache of package files to be
        copied to the image. It does not need to be specified.

    pkgs
        A list of packages to be installed on this image. For RedHat, this
        will include ``yum``, ``centos-release`` and ``iputils`` by default.

    exclude_pkgs
        A list of packages to be excluded. If you do not want to install the
        defaults, you need to include them in this list.

    epel_url
        The URL to download the EPEL release package from.

    CLI Examples:

        salt myminion genesis.bootstrap pacman /root/arch
        salt myminion genesis.bootstrap rpm /root/redhat
        salt myminion genesis.bootstrap deb /root/wheezy arch=amd64             flavor=wheezy static_qemu=/usr/bin/qemu-x86_64-static

    

genesis.ldd_deps:

    Recurse through a set of dependencies reported by ``ldd``, to find
    associated dependencies.

    Please note that this does not necessarily resolve all (non-package)
    dependencies for a file; but it does help.

    CLI Example:

        salt myminion genesis.ldd_deps bash
        salt myminion genesis.ldd_deps /bin/bash
    

genesis.mksls:

    Convert an installation file/script to an SLS file. Currently supports
    ``kickstart``, ``preseed``, and ``autoyast``.

    CLI Examples:

        salt <minion> genesis.mksls kickstart /path/to/kickstart.cfg
        salt <minion> genesis.mksls kickstart /path/to/kickstart.cfg /path/to/dest.sls

    Unpack an image into a directory structure

    CLI Example:

        salt myminion genesis.unpack centos /root/centos
    

git.add:

    Changed in version 2015.8.0
        The ``--verbose`` command line argument is now implied

    Interface to `git-add(1)`_

    cwd
        The path to the git checkout

    filename
        The location of the file/directory to add, relative to ``cwd``

    opts
        Any additional options to add to the command line, in a single string

        Note:
            On the Salt CLI, if the opts are preceded with a dash, it is
            necessary to precede them with ``opts=`` (as in the CLI examples
            below) to avoid causing errors with Salt's own argument parsing.

    git_opts
        Any additional options to add to git command itself (not the ``add``
        subcommand), in a single string. This is useful for passing ``-c`` to
        run git with temporary changes to the git configuration.

        New in version 2017.7.0

        Note:
            This is only supported in git 1.7.2 and newer.

    user
        User under which to run the git command. By default, the command is run
        by the user under which the minion is running.

    password
        Windows only. Required when specifying ``user``. This parameter will be
        ignored on non-Windows platforms.

      New in version 2016.3.4

    ignore_retcode : False
        If ``True``, do not log an error to the minion log if the git command
        returns a nonzero exit status.

        New in version 2015.8.0

    output_encoding
        Use this option to specify which encoding to use to decode the output
        from any git commands which are run. This should not be needed in most
        cases.

        Note:
            This should only be needed if the files in the repository were
            created with filenames using an encoding other than UTF-8 to handle
            Unicode characters.

        New in version 2018.3.1

    .. _`git-add(1)`: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-add

        salt myminion git.add /path/to/repo foo/bar.py opts='--dry-run'
    

git.archive:

    Changed in version 2015.8.0
        Returns ``True`` if successful, raises an error if not.

    Interface to `git-archive(1)`_, exports a tarball/zip file of the
    repository

    cwd
        The path to be archived

        Note:
            ``git archive`` permits a partial archive to be created. Thus, this
            path does not need to be the root of the git repository. Only the
            files within the directory specified by ``cwd`` (and its
            subdirectories) will be in the resulting archive. For example, if
            there is a git checkout at ``/tmp/foo``, then passing
            ``/tmp/foo/bar`` as the ``cwd`` will result in just the files
            underneath ``/tmp/foo/bar`` to be exported as an archive.

    output
        The path of the archive to be created

    overwrite : False
        Unless set to ``True``, Salt will over overwrite an existing archive at
        the path specified by the ``output`` argument.

        New in version 2015.8.0

    rev : HEAD
        The revision from which to create the archive

    format
        Manually specify the file format of the resulting archive. This
        argument can be omitted, and ``git archive`` will attempt to guess the
        archive type (and compression) from the filename. ``zip``, ``tar``,
        ``tar.gz``, and ``tgz`` are extensions that are recognized
        automatically, and git can be configured to support other archive types
        with the addition of git configuration keys.

        See the `git-archive(1)`_ manpage explanation of the
        ``--format`` argument (as well as the ``CONFIGURATION`` section of the
        manpage) for further information.

        New in version 2015.8.0

    prefix
        Prepend ``<prefix>`` to every filename in the archive. If unspecified,
        the name of the directory at the top level of the repository will be
        used as the prefix (e.g. if ``cwd`` is set to ``/foo/bar/baz``, the
        prefix will be ``baz``, and the resulting archive will contain a
        top-level directory by that name).

        Note:
            The default behavior if the ``--prefix`` option for ``git archive``
            is not specified is to not prepend a prefix, so Salt's behavior
            differs slightly from ``git archive`` in this respect. Use
            ``prefix=''`` to create an archive with no prefix.

        Changed in version 2015.8.0
            The behavior of this argument has been changed slightly. As of
            this version, it is necessary to include the trailing slash when
            specifying a prefix, if the prefix is intended to create a
            top-level directory.

    git_opts
        Any additional options to add to git command itself (not the
        ``archive`` subcommand), in a single string. This is useful for passing
        ``-c`` to run git with temporary changes to the git configuration.

        User under which to run the git command. By default, the command is run
        by the user under which the minion is running.

    password
        Windows only. Required when specifying ``user``. This parameter will be
        ignored on non-Windows platforms.

        If ``True``, do not log an error to the minion log if the git command
        returns a nonzero exit status.

        New in version 2015.8.0

    output_encoding
        Use this option to specify which encoding to use to decode the output
        from any git commands which are run. This should not be needed in most
        cases.

        Note:
            This should only be needed if the files in the repository were
            created with filenames using an encoding other than UTF-8 to handle
            Unicode characters.

git.branch:

    Interface to `git-branch(1)`_

    cwd
        The path to the git checkout

    name
        Name of the branch on which to operate. If not specified, the current
        branch will be assumed.

    opts
        Any additional options to add to the command line, in a single string

        Note:
            To create a branch based on something other than HEAD, pass the
            name of the revision as ``opts``. If the revision is in the format
            ``remotename/branch``, then this will also set the remote tracking
            branch.

            Additionally, on the Salt CLI, if the opts are preceded with a
            dash, it is necessary to precede them with ``opts=`` (as in the CLI
            examples below) to avoid causing errors with Salt's own argument
            parsing.

            directory.

    url
        The URL of the repository to be cloned

        Changed in version 2015.8.0
            Argument renamed from ``repository`` to ``url``

    name
        Optional alternate name for the top-level directory to be created by
        the clone

        New in version 2015.8.0

    opts
        Any additional options to add to the command line, in a single string

    git_opts
        Any additional options to add to git command itself (not the ``clone``
        subcommand), in a single string. This is useful for passing ``-c`` to
        run git with temporary changes to the git configuration.

    identity
        Path to a private key to use for ssh URLs

        Warning:

            Unless Salt is invoked from the minion using ``salt-call``, the
            key(s) must be passphraseless. For greater security with
            passphraseless private keys, see the `sshd(8)`_ manpage for
            information on securing the keypair from the remote side in the
            ``authorized_keys`` file.

            Salt will no longer attempt to use passphrase-protected keys unless
            invoked from the minion using ``salt-call``, to prevent blocking
            waiting for user input.

        Commit message

    opts
        Any additional options to add to the command line, in a single string.
        These opts will be added to the end of the git command being run.

        Note:
            On the Salt CLI, if the opts are preceded with a dash, it is
            necessary to precede them with ``opts=`` (as in the CLI examples
            below) to avoid causing errors with Salt's own argument parsing.

            The ``-m`` option should not be passed here, as the commit message
            will be defined by the ``message`` argument.

    git_opts
        Any additional options to add to git command itself (not the ``commit``

        Any additional options to add to the command line, in a single string

        Note:
            On the Salt CLI, if the opts are preceded with a dash, it is
            necessary to precede them with ``opts=`` (as in the CLI examples
            below) to avoid causing errors with Salt's own argument parsing.

    git_opts
        Any additional options to add to git command itself (not the ``diff``
        subcommand), in a single string. This is useful for passing ``-c`` to
        run git with temporary changes to the git configuration.

    no_index : False
        When it is necessary to diff two files in the same repo against each
        other, and not diff two different revisions, set this option to
        ``True``. If this is left ``False`` in these instances, then a normal
        ``git diff`` will be performed against the index (i.e. unstaged
        changes), and files in the ``paths`` option will be used to narrow down
        the diff output.

        Note:
            Requires Git 1.5.1 or newer. Additionally, when set to ``True``,
            ``item1`` and ``item2`` will be ignored.

    cached : False
        If ``True``, compare staged changes to ``item1`` (if specified),
        otherwise compare them to the most recent commit.

        Note:
            ``item2`` is ignored if this option is is set to ``True``.

    paths
        File paths to pass to the ``git diff`` command. Can be passed as a
        comma-separated list or a Python list.

    output_encoding
        Use this option to specify which encoding to use to decode the output
        from any git commands which are run. This should not be needed in most
        cases.

        Note:
            This should only be needed if the files in the repository were
            created with filenames using an encoding other than UTF-8 to handle
            Unicode characters.

        Note:
            On the Salt CLI, if the opts are preceded with a dash, it is
            necessary to precede them with ``opts=`` (as in the CLI examples

    git_opts
        Any additional options to add to git command itself (not the ``merge``
        subcommand), in a single string. This is useful for passing ``-c`` to
        run git with temporary changes to the git configuration.

    password
        Windows only. Required when specifying ``user``. This parameter will be
        ignored on non-Windows platforms.

      New in version 2016.3.4

    identity
        Path to a private key to use for ssh URLs. Salt will not attempt to use
        passphrase-protected keys unless invoked from the minion using
        ``salt-call``, to prevent blocking waiting for user input. Key can also
        be specified as a SaltStack file server URL, eg.
        ``salt://location/identity_file``.

    output_encoding
        Use this option to specify which encoding to use to decode the output

        Note:
            This should only be needed if the files in the repository were

git.merge_base:

    New in version 2015.8.0

    Interface to `git-merge-base(1)`_.

    cwd
        The path to the git checkout

    refs
        Any refs/commits to check for a merge base. Can be passed as a
        comma-separated list or a Python list.

    all : False
        Return a list of all matching merge bases. Not compatible with any of
        the below options except for ``octopus``.

    octopus : False
        If ``True``, then this function will determine the best common
        ancestors of all specified commits, in preparation for an n-way merge.
        See here_ for a description of how these bases are determined.

        Set ``all`` to ``True`` with this option to return all computed merge
        bases, otherwise only the "best" will be returned.

    is_ancestor : False
        If ``True``, then instead of returning the merge base, return a
        boolean telling whether or not the first commit is an ancestor of the
        second commit.

        Note:
            This option requires two commits to be passed.

        Changed in version 2015.8.2
            Works properly in git versions older than 1.8.0, where the
            ``--is-ancestor`` CLI option is not present.

    independent : False
        If ``True``, this function will return the IDs of the refs/commits
        passed which cannot be reached by another commit.

    fork_point
        If passed, then this function will return the commit where the
        commit diverged from the ref specified by ``fork_point``. If no fork
        point is found, ``None`` is returned.

        Note:
            At most one commit is permitted to be passed if a ``fork_point`` is
            specified. If no commits are passed, then ``HEAD`` is assumed.

    opts
        Any additional options to add to the command line, in a single string

        Note:
            On the Salt CLI, if the opts are preceded with a dash, it is

            below) to avoid causing errors with Salt's own argument parsing.

            This option should not be necessary unless new CLI arguments are
            added to `git-merge-base(1)`_ and are not yet supported in Salt.

    git_opts
        Any additional options to add to git command itself (not the
        ``merge-base`` subcommand), in a single string. This is useful for
        passing ``-c`` to run git with temporary changes to the git

git.symbolic_ref:

    New in version 2015.8.0

    Interface to `git-symbolic-ref(1)`_

    cwd
        The path to the git checkout

    ref
        Symbolic ref to read/modify

    value
        If passed, then the symbolic ref will be set to this value and an empty
        string will be returned.

        If not passed, then the ref to which ``ref`` points will be returned,
        unless ``--delete`` is included in ``opts`` (in which case the symbolic
        ref will be deleted).

    opts
        Any additional options to add to the command line, in a single string

    git_opts
        Any additional options to add to git command itself (not the
        ``symbolic-refs`` subcommand), in a single string. This is useful for
        passing ``-c`` to run git with temporary changes to the git
        configuration.

        New in version 2017.7.0

        Note:
            This is only supported in git 1.7.2 and newer.

    user
        User under which to run the git command. By default, the command is run
        by the user under which the minion is running.

    password
        Windows only. Required when specifying ``user``. This parameter will be
        ignored on non-Windows platforms.

      New in version 2016.3.4

    ignore_retcode : False
        If ``True``, do not log an error to the minion log if the git command
        returns a nonzero exit status.

        New in version 2015.8.0

    output_encoding
        Use this option to specify which encoding to use to decode the output
        from any git commands which are run. This should not be needed in most
        cases.

        Note:
            This should only be needed if the files in the repository were
            created with filenames using an encoding other than UTF-8 to handle
            Unicode characters.

        New in version 2018.3.1

    name
        Name of the tag

    ref : HEAD
        Which ref to tag (defaults to local clone's HEAD)

        Note:
            This argument is ignored when either ``-d`` or ``--delete`` is
            present in the ``opts`` passed to this function.

    message
        Optional message to include with the tag. If provided, an annotated tag
        will be created.

    opts
        Any additional options to add to the command line, in a single string

        Note:
            Additionally, on the Salt CLI, if the opts are preceded with a
            dash, it is necessary to precede them with ``opts=`` (as in the CLI
            examples below) to avoid causing errors with Salt's own argument
            parsing.

    git_opts
        Any additional options to add to git command itself (not the
        ``worktree`` subcommand), in a single string. This is useful for
        passing ``-c`` to run git with temporary changes to the git
        configuration.

        Note:
            This is only supported in git 1.7.2 and newer.

    user
        User under which to run the git command. By default, the command is run
        by the user under which the minion is running.

    password
        Windows only. Required when specifying ``user``. This parameter will be
        ignored on non-Windows platforms.

    ignore_retcode : False
        If ``True``, do not log an error to the minion log if the git command
        returns a nonzero exit status.

    output_encoding
        Use this option to specify which encoding to use to decode the output
        from any git commands which are run. This should not be needed in most
        cases.

        Note:
            This should only be needed if the files in the repository were
            created with filenames using an encoding other than UTF-8 to handle
            Unicode characters.

    .. _`git-tag(1)`: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag

    CLI Example:

        # Create an non-annotated tag
        salt myminion git.tag /path/to/repo v1.2
        # Create an annotated tag
        salt myminion git.tag /path/to/repo v1.2 message='Version 1.2'

    CLI Example:

        salt myminion git.version
    

git.worktree_add:

    New in version 2015.8.0

    Interface to `git-worktree(1)`_, adds a worktree

    cwd
        The path to the git checkout

    worktree_path
        Path to the new worktree. Can be either absolute, or relative to
        ``cwd``.

    branch
        Name of new branch to create. If omitted, will be set to the basename
        of the ``worktree_path``. For example, if the ``worktree_path`` is
        ``/foo/bar/baz``, then ``branch`` will be ``baz``.

    ref
        Name of the ref on which to base the new worktree. If omitted, then
        ``HEAD`` is use, and a new branch will be created, named for the
        basename of the ``worktree_path``. For example, if the
        ``worktree_path`` is ``/foo/bar/baz`` then a new branch ``baz`` will be
        created, and pointed at ``HEAD``.

    reset_branch : False
        If ``False``, then `git-worktree(1)`_ will fail to create the worktree
        if the targeted branch already exists. Set this argument to ``True`` to
        reset the targeted branch to point at ``ref``, and checkout the
        newly-reset branch into the new worktree.

    force : False
        By default, `git-worktree(1)`_ will not permit the same branch to be
        checked out in more than one worktree. Set this argument to ``True`` to
        override this.

    opts
        Any additional options to add to the command line, in a single string

        Note:
            On the Salt CLI, if the opts are preceded with a dash, it is
            necessary to precede them with ``opts=`` to avoid causing errors
            with Salt's own argument parsing.

            All CLI options for adding worktrees as of Git 2.5.0 are already
            supported by this function as of Salt 2015.8.0, so using this
            argument is unnecessary unless new CLI arguments are added to
            `git-worktree(1)`_ and are not yet supported in Salt.

    git_opts
        Any additional options to add to git command itself (not the
        ``worktree`` subcommand), in a single string. This is useful for
        passing ``-c`` to run git with temporary changes to the git

git.worktree_prune:

    New in version 2015.8.0

    Interface to `git-worktree(1)`_, prunes stale worktree administrative data
    from the gitdir

    cwd
        The path to the main git checkout or a linked worktree

    dry_run : False
        If ``True``, then this function will report what would have been
        pruned, but no changes will be made.

    verbose : True
        Report all changes made. Set to ``False`` to suppress this output.

    expire
        Only prune unused worktree data older than a specific period of time.
        The date format for this parameter is described in the documentation
        for the ``gc.pruneWorktreesExpire`` config param in the
        `git-config(1)`_ manpage.

    opts
        Any additional options to add to the command line, in a single string

git.worktree_rm:

    New in version 2015.8.0

    Recursively removes the worktree located at ``cwd``, returning ``True`` if
    successful. This function will attempt to determine if ``cwd`` is actually
    a worktree by invoking :py:func:`git.is_worktree
    <salt.modules.git.is_worktree>`. If the path does not correspond to a
    worktree, then an error will be raised and no action will be taken.

    Warning:

        There is no undoing this action. Be **VERY** careful before running
        this function.

    cwd
        Path to the worktree to be removed

    user
        Used for path expansion when ``cwd`` is not an absolute path. By
        default, when ``cwd`` is not absolute, the path will be assumed to be
        relative to the home directory of the user under which the minion is
        running. Setting this option will change the home directory from which
        path expansion is performed.

    output_encoding
        Use this option to specify which encoding to use to decode the output
        from any git commands which are run. This should not be needed in most
        cases.

        Note:
            This should only be needed if the files in the repository were

gpg.create_key:

    Create a key in the GPG keychain

    Note:

        GPG key generation requires *a lot* of entropy and randomness.
        Difficult to do over a remote connection, consider having
        another process available which is generating randomness for
        the machine. Also especially difficult on virtual machines,
        consider the `rng-tools
        <http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/user/tlecarrour/rng-tools.html>`_
        package.

        The create_key process takes awhile so increasing the timeout
        may be necessary, e.g. -t 15.

    key_type

    subkey_length
        The length of the secondary key in bits.

    expire_date
        The expiration date for the primary and any secondary key.
        You can specify an ISO date, A number of days/weeks/months/years,
        an epoch value, or 0 for a non-expiring key.

    use_passphrase
        Whether to use a passphrase with the signing key. The passphrase is
        retrieved from the Pillar key ``gpg_passphrase``.

    user
        Which user's keychain to access, defaults to user Salt is running as.
        Passing the user as ``salt`` will set the GnuPG home directory to
        ``/etc/salt/gpgkeys``.

    gnupghome
        Specify the location where the GPG keyring and related files are stored.

    keyring
        Limit the operation to this specific keyring, specified as
        a local filesystem path.

        from Pillar value ``gpg_passphrase``.

    gnupghome
        Specify the location where the GPG keyring and related files are stored.

    bare
        If ``True``, return the (armored) decrypted block as a string without the

grains.append:

    New in version 0.17.0

    Append a value to a list in the grains config file. If the grain doesn't

    val
        The value to append to the grain key

    convert
        If convert is True, convert non-list contents into a list.
        If convert is False and the grain contains non-list contents, an error
        is given. Defaults to False.

    delimiter
        The key can be a nested dict key. Use this parameter to
        specify the delimiter you use, instead of the default ``:``.
        You can now append values to a list in nested dictionary grains. If the
        list doesn't exist at this level, it will be created.

        New in version 2014.7.6

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' grains.append key val
    

grains.delkey:

    New in version 2017.7.0

    Remove a grain completely from the grain system, this will remove the
    grain key and value

    key
        The grain key from which to delete the value.

    force
        Force remove the grain even when it is a mapped value.
        Defaults to False

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' grains.delkey key
    

grains.delval:

    New in version 0.17.0

    Delete a grain value from the grains config file. This will just set the
    grain value to ``None``. To completely remove the grain, run ``grains.delkey``
    or pass ``destructive=True`` to ``grains.delval``.

    key
        The grain key from which to delete the value.

    destructive
        Delete the key, too. Defaults to False.

    force
        Force remove the grain even when it is a mapped value.
        Defaults to False

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' grains.delval key
    

grains.equals:

    Used to make sure the minion's grain key/value matches.

    New in version 2017.7.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' grains.equals fqdn <expected_fqdn>
        salt '*' grains.equals systemd:version 219
    

grains.fetch:

    Attempt to retrieve the named value from grains, if the named value is not
    available return the passed default. The default return is an empty string.

    The value can also represent a value in a nested dict using a ":" delimiter
    for the dict. This means that if a dict in grains looks like this::

        {'pkg': {'apache': 'httpd'}}

    To retrieve the value associated with the apache key in the pkg dict this
    key can be passed::

        pkg:apache


    :param delimiter:
        Specify an alternate delimiter to use when traversing a nested dict.
        This is useful for when the desired key contains a colon. See CLI
        example below for usage.

        New in version 2014.7.0

    :param ordered:
        Outputs an ordered dict if applicable (default: True)

        New in version 2016.11.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' grains.get pkg:apache
        salt '*' grains.get abc::def|ghi delimiter='|'
    

grains.filter_by:

    New in version 0.17.0

    Look up the given grain in a given dictionary for the current OS and return
    the result

    Although this may occasionally be useful at the CLI, the primary intent of
    this function is for use in Jinja to make short work of creating lookup
    tables for OS-specific data. For example:

        {% set apache = salt['grains.filter_by']({
            'Debian': {'pkg': 'apache2', 'srv': 'apache2'},
            'RedHat': {'pkg': 'httpd', 'srv': 'httpd'},
        }, default='Debian') %}

        myapache:
          pkg.installed:
            - name: {{ apache.pkg }}
          service.running:
            - name: {{ apache.srv }}

    Values in the lookup table may be overridden by values in Pillar. An
    example Pillar to override values in the example above could be as follows:

        apache:
          lookup:
            pkg: apache_13
            srv: apache

    The call to ``filter_by()`` would be modified as follows to reference those
    Pillar values:

        {% set apache = salt['grains.filter_by']({
            ...
        }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('apache:lookup')) %}


    :param lookup_dict: A dictionary, keyed by a grain, containing a value or
        values relevant to systems matching that grain. For example, a key
        could be the grain for an OS and the value could the name of a package
        on that particular OS.

        Changed in version 2016.11.0

            The dictionary key could be a globbing pattern. The function will
            return the corresponding ``lookup_dict`` value where grain value
            matches the pattern. For example:

                # this will render 'got some salt' if Minion ID begins from 'salt'
                salt '*' grains.filter_by '{salt*: got some salt, default: salt is not here}' id

    :param grain: The name of a grain to match with the current system's
        grains. For example, the value of the "os_family" grain for the current
        system could be used to pull values from the ``lookup_dict``
        dictionary.

        Changed in version 2016.11.0

            The grain value could be a list. The function will return the
            ``lookup_dict`` value for a first found item in the list matching
            one of the ``lookup_dict`` keys.

    :param merge: A dictionary to merge with the results of the grain selection
        from ``lookup_dict``. This allows Pillar to override the values in the
        ``lookup_dict``. This could be useful, for example, to override the
        values for non-standard package names such as when using a different
        Python version from the default Python version provided by the OS
        (e.g., ``python26-mysql`` instead of ``python-mysql``).

    :param default: default lookup_dict's key used if the grain does not exists
        or if the grain value has no match on lookup_dict.  If unspecified
        the value is "default".

        New in version 2014.1.0

    :param base: A lookup_dict key to use for a base dictionary.  The
        grain-selected ``lookup_dict`` is merged over this and then finally
        the ``merge`` dictionary is merged.  This allows common values for
        each case to be collected in the base and overridden by the grain
        selection dictionary and the merge dictionary.  Default is unset.

        New in version 2015.5.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' grains.filter_by '{Debian: Debheads rule, RedHat: I love my hat}'
        # this one will render {D: {E: I, G: H}, J: K}
        salt '*' grains.filter_by '{A: B, C: {D: {E: F, G: H}}}' 'xxx' '{D: {E: I}, J: K}' 'C'
        # next one renders {A: {B: G}, D: J}
        salt '*' grains.filter_by '{default: {A: {B: C}, D: E}, F: {A: {B: G}}, H: {D: I}}' 'xxx' '{D: J}' 'F' 'default'
        # next same as above when default='H' instead of 'F' renders {A: {B: C}, D: J}
    

grains.get:

    Attempt to retrieve the named value from grains, if the named value is not
    available return the passed default. The default return is an empty string.

    The value can also represent a value in a nested dict using a ":" delimiter
    for the dict. This means that if a dict in grains looks like this::

        {'pkg': {'apache': 'httpd'}}

    To retrieve the value associated with the apache key in the pkg dict this
    key can be passed::

        pkg:apache


    :param delimiter:
        Specify an alternate delimiter to use when traversing a nested dict.
        This is useful for when the desired key contains a colon. See CLI
        example below for usage.

        New in version 2014.7.0

    :param ordered:

    delimiter
        The key can be a nested dict key. Use this parameter to
        specify the delimiter you use, instead of the default ``:``.
        You can now append values to a list in nested dictionary grains. If the
        list doesn't exist at this level, it will be created.

        New in version 2015.8.2

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' grains.remove key val
    

grains.set:

    Set a key to an arbitrary value. It is used like setval but works
    with nested keys.

    This function is conservative. It will only overwrite an entry if
    its value and the given one are not a list or a dict. The ``force``
    parameter is used to allow overwriting in all cases.

    New in version 2015.8.0

    :param force: Force writing over existing entry if given or existing
                  values are list or dict. Defaults to False.
    :param destructive: If an operation results in a key being removed,
                  delete the key, too. Defaults to False.
    :param delimiter:
        Specify an alternate delimiter to use when traversing a nested dict,

iptables.append:

    Append a rule to the specified table/chain.

    This function accepts a rule in a standard iptables command format,
        starting with the chain. Trying to force users to adapt to a new
        method of creating rules would be irritating at best, and we
        already have a parser that can handle it.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' iptables.append filter INPUT \
            rule='-m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT'

        IPv6:
        salt '*' iptables.append filter INPUT \
            rule='-m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT' \
            family=ipv6
    

iptables.build_rule:

    Build a well-formatted iptables rule based on kwargs. A `table` and `chain`
    are not required, unless `full` is True.

    If `full` is `True`, then `table`, `chain` and `command` are required.
    `command` may be specified as either a short option ('I') or a long option
    (`--insert`). This will return the iptables command, exactly as it would
    be used from the command line.

    If a position is required (as with `-I` or `-D`), it may be specified as
    `position`. This will only be useful if `full` is True.

    If `state` is passed, it will be ignored, use `connstate`.
    If `connstate` is passed in, it will automatically be changed to `state`.

    To pass in jump options that doesn't take arguments, pass in an empty
    string.

    Note:

        Whereas iptables will accept ``-p``, ``--proto[c[o[l]]]`` as synonyms
        of ``--protocol``, if ``--proto`` appears in an iptables command after
        the appearance of ``-m policy``, it is interpreted as the ``--proto``
        option of the policy extension (see the iptables-extensions(8) man
        page).

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' iptables.build_rule match=state \
            connstate=RELATED,ESTABLISHED jump=ACCEPT

        salt '*' iptables.build_rule filter INPUT command=I position=3 \

    This function accepts a rule in a standard iptables command format,
        starting with the chain. Trying to force users to adapt to a new
        method of creating rules would be irritating at best, and we
        already have a parser that can handle it.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' iptables.check filter INPUT \
            rule='-m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT'

        IPv6:

    Delete a rule from the specified table/chain, specifying either the rule
        in its entirety, or the rule's position in the chain.

    This function accepts a rule in a standard iptables command format,
        starting with the chain. Trying to force users to adapt to a new
        method of creating rules would be irritating at best, and we
        already have a parser that can handle it.

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' iptables.delete filter INPUT position=3
        salt '*' iptables.delete filter INPUT \
            rule='-m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT'

        IPv6:
        salt '*' iptables.delete filter INPUT position=3 family=ipv6

iptables.insert:

    Insert a rule into the specified table/chain, at the specified position.

    This function accepts a rule in a standard iptables command format,
        starting with the chain. Trying to force users to adapt to a new
        method of creating rules would be irritating at best, and we
        already have a parser that can handle it.

    If the position specified is a negative number, then the insert will be
        performed counting from the end of the list. For instance, a position
        of -1 will insert the rule as the second to last rule. To insert a rule
        in the last position, use the append function instead.

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' iptables.insert filter INPUT position=3 \
            rule='-m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT'

        salt '*' lowpkg.info apache2 bash
        salt '*' lowpkg.info 'php5*' failhard=false
    

lowpkg.list_pkgs:

    List the packages currently installed in a dict::

        {'<package_name>': '<version>'}

    External dependencies::

        Virtual package resolution requires aptitude. Because this function
        uses dpkg, virtual packages will be reported as not installed.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' lowpkg.list_pkgs
        salt '*' lowpkg.list_pkgs hostname
        salt '*' lowpkg.list_pkgs hostname mount
    

lowpkg.unpurge:

    Change package selection for each package specified to 'install'

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' lowpkg.unpurge curl
    

mandrill.send:

    Send out the email using the details from the ``message`` argument.

    message
        The information on the message to send. This argument must be
        sent as dictionary with at fields as specified in the Mandrill API
        documentation.

    asynchronous: ``False``
        Enable a background sending mode that is optimized for bulk sending.
        In asynchronous mode, messages/send will immediately return a status of
        "queued" for every recipient. To handle rejections when sending in asynchronous
        mode, set up a webhook for the 'reject' event. Defaults to false for
        messages with no more than 10 recipients; messages with more than 10
        recipients are always sent asynchronously, regardless of the value of
        asynchronous.

    ip_pool
        The name of the dedicated ip pool that should be used to send the
        message. If you do not have any dedicated IPs, this parameter has no
        effect. If you specify a pool that does not exist, your default pool
        will be used instead.

    send_at
        When this message should be sent as a UTC timestamp in
        ``YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`` format. If you specify a time in the past,
        the message will be sent immediately. An additional fee applies for
        scheduled email, and this feature is only available to accounts with a
        positive balance.

    Note:
        Fur further details please consult the `API documentation <https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/messages.dart.html>`_.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' mandrill.send message="{'subject': 'Hi', 'from_email': 'test@example.com', 'to': [{'email': 'recv@example.com', 'type': 'to'}]}"

    ``message`` structure example (as YAML for readability):

        message:
            text: |
                This is the body of the email.
                This is the second line.
            subject: Email subject
            from_name: Test At Example Dot Com
            from_email: test@example.com

        {% set roles = salt['match.filter_by']({
            'web*': ['app', 'caching'],
            'db*': ['db'],
        }, minion_id=grains['id'], default='web*') %}

        # Make the filtered data available to Pillar:
        roles: {{ roles | yaml() }}
    

match.glob:

    Return True if the minion ID matches the given glob target

    minion_id
        Specify the minion ID to match against the target expression

        New in version 2014.7.0

    CLI Example:

    delimiter
        Specify an alternate delimiter to use when traversing a nested dict

        New in version 2014.7.0

    delim

        .. deprecated:: 2015.8.0
    

match.grain_pcre:

    Return True if the minion matches the given grain_pcre target. The
    ``delimiter`` argument can be used to specify a different delimiter.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' match.grain_pcre 'os:Fedo.*'
        salt '*' match.grain_pcre 'ipv6|2001:.*' delimiter='|'

        .. deprecated:: 2015.8.0
    

match.ifelse:

    New in version 3006.0

    Evaluate each pair of arguments up to the last one as a (matcher, value)
    tuple, returning ``value`` if matched.  If none match, returns the last
    argument.

    The ``ifelse`` function is like a multi-level if-else statement. It was
    inspired by CFEngine's ``ifelse`` function which in turn was inspired by
    Oracle's ``DECODE`` function. It must have an odd number of arguments (from
    1 to N). The last argument is the default value, like the ``else`` clause in
    standard programming languages. Every pair of arguments before the last one
    are evaluated as a pair. If the first one evaluates true then the second one
    is returned, as if you had used the first one in a compound match
    expression. Boolean values can also be used as the first item in a pair,
    as it will be translated to a match that will always match ("*") or never
    match ("SALT_IFELSE_MATCH_NOTHING") a target system.

    This is essentially another way to express the ``filter_by`` functionality
    in way that's familiar to CFEngine or Oracle users. Consider using
    ``filter_by`` unless this function fits your workflow.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' match.ifelse 'foo*' 'Foo!' 'bar*' 'Bar!' minion_id=bar03
    

match.ipcidr:

    Return True if the minion matches the given ipcidr target

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' match.ipcidr '192.168.44.0/24'

    delimiter
    Pillar Example:

       '172.16.0.0/12':
         - match: ipcidr
         - nodeclass: internal

    

match.list:

    Return True if the minion ID matches the given list target

    minion_id
        Specify the minion ID to match against the target expression

        New in version 2014.7.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' match.list 'server1,server2'
    

match.pcre:

    Return True if the minion ID matches the given pcre target

    minion_id
        Specify the minion ID to match against the target expression

        New in version 2014.7.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' match.pcre '.*'
    

match.pillar:

    Return True if the minion matches the given pillar target. The
    ``delimiter`` argument can be used to specify a different delimiter.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' match.pillar 'cheese:foo'
        salt '*' match.pillar 'clone_url|https://github.com/saltstack/salt.git' delimiter='|'

    delimiter
        Specify an alternate delimiter to use when traversing a nested dict

match.pillar_pcre:

    Return True if the minion matches the given pillar_pcre target. The
    ``delimiter`` argument can be used to specify a different delimiter.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' match.pillar_pcre 'cheese:(swiss|american)'
        salt '*' match.pillar_pcre 'clone_url|https://github\.com/.*\.git' delimiter='|'

        .. deprecated:: 2015.8.0
    

match.search_by:

    Search a dictionary of target strings for matching targets

    This is the inverse of :py:func:`match.filter_by
    <salt.modules.match.filter_by>` and allows matching values instead of
    matching keys. A minion can be matched by multiple entries.

    New in version 2017.7.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' match.search_by '{web: [node1, node2], db: [node2, node]}'

    Pillar Example:

        {% set roles = salt.match.search_by({
            'web': ['G@os_family:Debian not nodeX'],
            'db': ['L@node2,node3 and G@datacenter:west'],
            'caching': ['node3', 'node4'],
        }) %}

        # Make the filtered data available to Pillar:
        roles: {{ roles | yaml() }}
    

mattermost.post_message:

    Send a message to a Mattermost channel.

    :param channel:     The channel name, either will work.
    :param username:    The username of the poster.
    :param message:     The message to send to the Mattermost channel.
    :param api_url:     The Mattermost api url, if not specified in the configuration.
    :param hook:        The Mattermost hook, if not specified in the configuration.
    :return:            Boolean if message was sent successfully.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' mattermost.post_message message='Build is done'
    

mine.delete:

    Remove specific function contents of minion.

    :param str fun: The name of the function.
    :rtype: bool
    :return: True on success.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' mine.delete 'network.interfaces'
    

mine.flush:

    Remove all mine contents of minion.

    :rtype: bool
    :return: True on success

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' mine.flush
    

mine.get:

    Get data from the mine.

    :param str tgt: Target whose mine data to get.
    :param fun: Function to get the mine data of. You can specify multiple functions
        to retrieve using either a list or a comma-separated string of functions.
    :type fun: str or list
    :param str tgt_type: Default ``glob``. Target type to use with ``tgt``.
        See :ref:`targeting` for more information.
        Note that all pillar matches, whether using the compound matching system or
        the pillar matching system, will be exact matches, with globbing disabled.
    :param bool exclude_minion: Excludes the current minion from the result set.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' mine.get '*' network.interfaces
        salt '*' mine.get 'os:Fedora' network.interfaces grain
        salt '*' mine.get 'G@os:Fedora and S@192.168.5.0/24' network.ipaddrs compound

    .. seealso:: Retrieving Mine data from Pillar and Orchestrate

        This execution module is intended to be executed on minions.
        Master-side operations such as Pillar or Orchestrate that require Mine
        data should use the :py:mod:`Mine Runner module <salt.runners.mine>`
        instead; it can be invoked from a Pillar SLS file using the
        :py:func:`saltutil.runner <salt.modules.saltutil.runner>` module. For
        example:

            {% set minion_ips = salt.saltutil.runner('mine.get',
                tgt='*',
                fun='network.ip_addrs',
                tgt_type='glob') %}
    

mine.get_docker:

    Changed in version 2017.7.8,2018.3.3
        When :conf_minion:`docker.update_mine` is set to ``False`` for a given
        minion, no mine data will be populated for that minion, and thus none
        will be returned for it.
    Changed in version 2019.2.0
        :conf_minion:`docker.update_mine` now defaults to ``False``

    Get all mine data for :py:func:`docker.ps <salt.modules.dockermod.ps_>` and
    run an aggregation routine. The ``interfaces`` parameter allows for
    specifying the network interfaces from which to select IP addresses. The
    ``cidrs`` parameter allows for specifying a list of subnets which the IP
    address must match.

    with_container_id
        Boolean, to expose container_id in the list of results

        New in version 2015.8.2

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' mine.get_docker
        salt '*' mine.get_docker interfaces='eth0'
        salt '*' mine.get_docker interfaces='["eth0", "eth1"]'
        salt '*' mine.get_docker cidrs='107.170.147.0/24'
        salt '*' mine.get_docker cidrs='["107.170.147.0/24", "172.17.42.0/24"]'
        salt '*' mine.get_docker interfaces='["eth0", "eth1"]' cidrs='["107.170.147.0/24", "172.17.42.0/24"]'
    

mine.send:

    Send a specific function and its result to the salt mine.
    This gets stored in either the local cache, or the salt master's cache.

    :param str name: Name of the function to add to the mine.

    The following pameters are extracted from kwargs if present:

    :param str mine_function: The name of the execution_module.function to run
        and whose value will be stored in the salt mine. Defaults to ``name``.
    :param str allow_tgt: Targeting specification for ACL. Specifies which minions
        are allowed to access this function. Please note both your master and
        minion need to be on, at least, version 3000 for this to work properly.

    :param str allow_tgt_type: Type of the targeting specification. This value will
        be ignored if ``allow_tgt`` is not specified. Please note both your
        master and minion need to be on, at least, version 3000 for this to work
        properly.

    Remaining args and kwargs will be passed on to the function to run.

    :rtype: bool
    :return: Whether executing the function and storing the information was successful.

    Changed in version 3000

        Added ``allow_tgt``- and ``allow_tgt_type``-parameters to specify which
        minions are allowed to access this function.
        See :ref:`targeting` for more information about targeting.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' mine.send network.ip_addrs interface=eth0
        salt '*' mine.send eth0_ip_addrs mine_function=network.ip_addrs interface=eth0
        salt '*' mine.send eth0_ip_addrs mine_function=network.ip_addrs interface=eth0 allow_tgt='G@grain:value' allow_tgt_type=compound
    

mine.update:

    Call the configured functions and send the data back up to the master.
    The functions to be called are merged from the master config, pillar and
    minion config under the option `mine_functions`:

        mine_functions:
          network.ip_addrs:
            - eth0
          disk.usage: []

    This function accepts the following arguments:

    :param bool clear: Default: ``False``
        Specifies whether updating will clear the existing values (``True``), or
        whether it will update them (``False``).

    :param dict mine_functions:
        Update (or clear, see ``clear``) the mine data on these functions only.
        This will need to have the structure as defined on
        https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/mine/index.html#mine-functions

        This feature can be used when updating the mine for functions
        that require a refresh at different intervals than the rest of
        the functions specified under `mine_functions` in the
        minion/master config or pillar.
        A potential use would be together with the `scheduler`, for example:

            schedule:
              lldp_mine_update:
                function: mine.update
                kwargs:
                    mine_functions:
                      net.lldp: []
                hours: 12

        In the example above, the mine for `net.lldp` would be refreshed
        every 12 hours, while  `network.ip_addrs` would continue to be updated
        as specified in `mine_interval`.

    The function cache will be populated with information from executing these
    functions

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' mine.update
    

mine.valid:

    List valid entries in mine configuration.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' mine.valid
    

minion.kill:

    Kill the salt minion.

    timeout
        int seconds to wait for the minion to die.

    If you have a monitor that restarts ``salt-minion`` when it dies then this is
    a great way to restart after a minion upgrade.

    CLI Example:

        salt minion[12] minion.kill

        minion1:
            ----------
            killed:
                7874
            retcode:
                0
        minion2:
            ----------
            killed:
                29071
            retcode:
                0

    The result of the salt command shows the process ID of the minions and the
    results of a kill signal to the minion in as the ``retcode`` value: ``0``
    is success, anything else is a failure.
    

minion.list:

    Return a list of accepted, denied, unaccepted and rejected keys.
    This is the same output as `salt-key -L`

    CLI Example:

        salt 'master' minion.list
    

minion.restart:

    Kill and restart the salt minion.

    The configuration key ``minion_restart_command`` is an argv list for the
    command to restart the minion.  If ``minion_restart_command`` is not
    specified or empty then the ``argv`` of the current process will be used.

    if the configuration value ``minion_restart_command`` is not set and the
    ``-d`` (daemonize) argument is missing from ``argv`` then the minion
    *will* be killed but will *not* be restarted and will require the parent
    process to perform the restart.  This behavior is intended for managed
    salt minion processes.

    CLI Example:

        salt minion[12] minion.restart

        minion1:
            ----------
            comment:

                -     -c
                -     /home/omniture/install/etc/salt
            killed:
                10070
            restart:
                ----------
                stderr:
                stdout:
            retcode:
                0

nftables.append:

    Append a rule to the specified table & chain.

    This function accepts a rule in a standard nftables command format,
        starting with the chain. Trying to force users to adapt to a new
        method of creating rules would be irritating at best, and we
        already have a parser that can handle it.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' nftables.append filter input \
            rule='tcp dport 22 log accept'

        IPv6:
        salt '*' nftables.append filter input \

            family=ipv6
    

nftables.build_rule:

    Build a well-formatted nftables rule based on kwargs.
    A `table` and `chain` are not required, unless `full` is True.

    If `full` is `True`, then `table`, `chain` and `command` are required.
    `command` may be specified as either insert, append, or delete.
    This will return the nftables command, exactly as it would
    be used from the command line.

    If a position is required (as with `insert` or `delete`), it may be specified as
    `position`. This will only be useful if `full` is True.

    If `connstate` is passed in, it will automatically be changed to `state`.

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' nftables.build_rule match=state \
            connstate=RELATED,ESTABLISHED jump=ACCEPT
        salt '*' nftables.build_rule filter input command=insert position=3 \
            full=True match=state state=related,established jump=accept

        IPv6:

    below) is equivalent to running ``nspawn.reboot``.

    Note:

        ``machinectl reboot`` is only supported in systemd >= 219. On earlier
        systemd versions, running this function will instead restart the
        container via ``systemctl``.

    CLI Examples:

        salt myminion nspawn.reboot arch1
        salt myminion nspawn.restart arch1
    

nspawn.remove:

    Remove the named container

    Warning:

        This function will remove all data associated with the container. It
        will not, however, remove the btrfs subvolumes created by pulling
        container images (:mod:`nspawn.pull_raw
        <salt.modules.nspawn.pull_raw>`, :mod:`nspawn.pull_tar
        <salt.modules.nspawn.pull_tar>`, :mod:`nspawn.pull_dkr
        <salt.modules.nspawn.pull_dkr>`).

    stop : False
        If ``True``, the container will be destroyed even if it is
        running/frozen.

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' nspawn.remove foo
        salt '*' nspawn.remove foo stop=True
    

nspawn.restart:

    This is a compatibility function which simply calls nspawn.reboot.

    use_vt : False
        Use SaltStack's utils.vt to stream output to console. Assumes
        ``output=all``.

    keep_env : None
        If not passed, only a sane default PATH environment variable will be
        set. If ``True``, all environment variables from the container's host
        will be kept. Otherwise, a comma-separated list (or Python list) of
        environment variable names can be passed, and those environment
        variables will be kept.

    CLI Example:

        salt myminion nspawn.retcode mycontainer 'ip addr show'

nspawn.stop:

    This is a compatibility function which provides the logic for
    nspawn.poweroff and nspawn.terminate.
    

nspawn.terminate:

    Kill all processes in the container without issuing a clean shutdown.
    Equivalent to running ``machinectl terminate`` on the named container.

    For convenience, running ``nspawn.stop`` and passing ``kill=True`` (as
    shown in the CLI examples below) is equivalent to running
    ``nspawn.terminate``.

    Note:

        ``machinectl terminate`` is only supported in systemd >= 219. On
        earlier systemd versions, running this function will simply issue a
        clean shutdown via ``systemctl``.

pagerduty_util.create_or_update_resource:

    create or update any pagerduty resource
    Helper method for present().

    Determining if two resources are the same is different for different PD resource, so this method accepts a diff function.
    The diff function will be invoked as diff(state_information, object_returned_from_pagerduty), and
    should return a dict of data to pass to the PagerDuty update API method, or None if no update
    is to be performed.  If no diff method is provided, the default behavor is to scan the keys in the state_information,
    comparing the matching values in the object_returned_from_pagerduty, and update any values that differ.

    examples:
        create_or_update_resource("user", ["id","name","email"])
        create_or_update_resource("escalation_policies", ["id","name"], diff=my_diff_function)

    

pagerduty_util.delete_resource:

    delete any pagerduty resource

    Helper method for absent()

    example:
            delete_resource("users", key, ["id","name","email"]) # delete by id or name or email

    

pagerduty_util.get_escalation_policies:

    List escalation_policies belonging to this account

    CLI Example:

        salt myminion pagerduty.get_escalation_policies
    

pagerduty_util.get_resource:

    Get any single pagerduty resource by key.

    We allow flexible lookup by any of a list of identifier_fields.
    So, for example, you can look up users by email address or name by calling:

            get_resource('users', key, ['name', 'email'], ...)

    This method is mainly used to translate state sls into pagerduty id's for dependent objects.
    For example, a pagerduty escalation policy contains one or more schedules, which must be passed
    by their pagerduty id.  We look up the schedules by name (using this method), and then translate
    the names into id's.

    This method is implemented by getting all objects of the resource type (cached into __context__),
    then brute force searching through the list and trying to match any of the identifier_fields.
    The __context__ cache is purged after any create, update or delete to the resource.
    

pagerduty_util.get_schedules:

    List schedules belonging to this account

    CLI Example:

        salt myminion pagerduty.get_schedules

    List services belonging to this account

    CLI Example:

        salt myminion pagerduty.get_services
    

pagerduty_util.get_users:

    List users belonging to this account

    CLI Example:

        salt myminion pagerduty.get_users
    

pagerduty_util.resource_absent:

    Generic resource.absent state method.   Pagerduty state modules should be a thin wrapper over this method,
    with a custom diff function.

    This method calls delete_resource() and formats the result as a salt state return value.

    example:
            resource_absent("users", ["id","name","email"])
    

pagerduty_util.resource_present:

    Generic resource.present state method.   Pagerduty state modules should be a thin wrapper over this method,
    with a custom diff function.

    This method calls create_or_update_resource() and formats the result as a salt state return value.

    example:
            resource_present("users", ["id","name","email"])

    A flag can be either "on" or "off" (make sure to use proper
    quoting, see :ref:`YAML Idiosyncrasies
    <yaml-idiosyncrasies>`). Some or all of these flags will be
    available, depending on what disk label you are using.

    Valid flags are:
      * cylinder_alignment

        salt '*' partition.list /dev/sda unit=kB
    

partition.mkfs:

    Makes a file system <fs_type> on partition <device>, destroying all data
    that resides on that partition. <fs_type> must be one of "ext2", "fat32",

partition.mkpart:

    Make a part_type partition for filesystem fs_type, beginning at start and
    ending at end (by default in megabytes).  part_type should be one of
    "primary", "logical", or "extended".

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' partition.mkpart /dev/sda primary fs_type=fat32 start=0 end=639
        salt '*' partition.mkpart /dev/sda primary start=0 end=639
    

partition.mkpartfs:

    The mkpartfs actually is an alias to mkpart and is kept for compatibility.
    To know the valid options and usage syntax read mkpart documentation.

    CLI Examples:

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' partition.name /dev/sda 1 'My Documents'
    

partition.probe:

    Ask the kernel to update its local partition data. When no args are

        salt '*' partition.probe
        salt '*' partition.probe /dev/sda
        salt '*' partition.probe /dev/sda /dev/sdb
    

partition.rescue:

    Rescue a lost partition that was located somewhere between start and end.

    entry for it in the partition table.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' partition.rescue /dev/sda 0 8056
    

partition.resize:

    Resizes the partition with number <minor>.

    The partition will start <start> from the beginning of the disk, and end
    <end> from the beginning of the disk. resize never changes the minor number.
    Extended partitions can be resized, so long as the new extended partition
    completely contains all logical partitions.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' partition.resize /dev/sda 3 200 850
    

partition.rm:

    Removes the partition with number <minor>.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' partition.rm /dev/sda 5
    

partition.set:

    Changes a flag on the partition with number <minor>.

    A flag can be either "on" or "off" (make sure to use proper quoting, see
    :ref:`YAML Idiosyncrasies <yaml-idiosyncrasies>`). Some or all of these
    flags will be available, depending on what disk label you are using.

    Valid flags are:
      * boot
      * root
      * swap
      * hidden
      * raid
      * lvm
      * lba

      * diag
      * legacy_boot
      * msftdata
      * irst
      * esp
      * type

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' partition.set /dev/sda 1 boot '"on"'
    

partition.set_id:

    Sets the system ID for the partition. Some typical values are::

         b: FAT32 (vfat)
         7: HPFS/NTFS
        82: Linux Swap
        83: Linux
        8e: Linux LVM
        fd: Linux RAID Auto

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' partition.set_id /dev/sda 1 83
    

partition.system_types:

    List the system types that are supported by the installed version of sfdisk

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' partition.system_types

    Toggle the state of <flag> on <partition>. Valid flags are the same as
        the set command.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' partition.toggle /dev/sda 1 boot

pillar.data:

    Calls the master for a fresh pillar, generates the pillar data on the
    fly (same as :py:func:`items`)

    pillar
        If specified, allows for a dictionary of pillar data to be made
        available to pillar and ext_pillar rendering. these pillar variables
        will also override any variables of the same name in pillar or
        ext_pillar.

    pillar_enc
        If specified, the data passed in the ``pillar`` argument will be passed
        through this renderer to decrypt it.

        Note:
            This will decrypt on the minion side, so the specified renderer
            must be set up on the minion for this to work. Alternatively,
            pillar data can be decrypted master-side. For more information, see
            the :ref:`Pillar Encryption <pillar-encryption>` documentation.
            Pillar data that is decrypted master-side, is not decrypted until
            the end of pillar compilation though, so minion-side decryption
            will be necessary if the encrypted pillar data must be made
            available in an decrypted state pillar/ext_pillar rendering.

    pillarenv
        Pass a specific pillar environment from which to compile pillar data.
        If not specified, then the minion's :conf_minion:`pillarenv` option is
        not used, and if that also is not specified then all configured pillar
        environments will be merged into a single pillar dictionary and
        returned.

    saltenv
        Included only for compatibility with
        :conf_minion:`pillarenv_from_saltenv`, and is otherwise ignored.

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' pillar.data
    

pillar.ext:

    Changed in version 2016.3.6,2016.11.3,2017.7.0
        The supported ext_pillar types are now tunable using the
        :conf_master:`on_demand_ext_pillar` config option. Earlier releases
        used a hard-coded default.

    Generate the pillar and apply an explicit external pillar


    external
        A single ext_pillar to add to the ext_pillar configuration. This must
        be passed as a single section from the ext_pillar configuration (see
        CLI examples below). For more complicated ``ext_pillar``
        configurations, it can be helpful to use the Python shell to load YAML
        configuration into a dictionary, and figure out

            >>> import salt.utils.yaml
            >>> ext_pillar = salt.utils.yaml.safe_load("""
            ... ext_pillar:
            ...   - git:
            ...     - issue38440 https://github.com/terminalmage/git_pillar:
            ...       - env: base
            ... """)
            >>> ext_pillar
            {'ext_pillar': [{'git': [{'mybranch https://github.com/myuser/myrepo': [{'env': 'base'}]}]}]}
            >>> ext_pillar['ext_pillar'][0]
            {'git': [{'mybranch https://github.com/myuser/myrepo': [{'env': 'base'}]}]}

        In the above example, the value to pass would be
        ``{'git': [{'mybranch https://github.com/myuser/myrepo': [{'env': 'base'}]}]}``.
        Note that this would need to be quoted when passing on the CLI (as in
        the CLI examples below).

    pillar : None
        If specified, allows for a dictionary of pillar data to be made
        available to pillar and ext_pillar rendering. These pillar variables
        will also override any variables of the same name in pillar or
        ext_pillar.

        New in version 2015.5.0

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' pillar.ext '{libvirt: _}'
        salt '*' pillar.ext "{'git': ['master https://github.com/myuser/myrepo']}"
        salt '*' pillar.ext "{'git': [{'mybranch https://github.com/myuser/myrepo': [{'env': 'base'}]}]}"
    

pillar.fetch:

    New in version 0.14.0

    Attempt to retrieve the named value from :ref:`in-memory pillar data
    <pillar-in-memory>`. If the pillar key is not present in the in-memory
    pillar, then the value specified in the ``default`` option (described
    below) will be returned.

    If the merge parameter is set to ``True``, the default will be recursively
    merged into the returned pillar data.

    The value can also represent a value in a nested dict using a ":" delimiter
    for the dict. This means that if a dict in pillar looks like this::

        {'pkg': {'apache': 'httpd'}}

    To retrieve the value associated with the ``apache`` key in the ``pkg``
    dict this key can be passed as::

        pkg:apache

    key
        The pillar key to get value from

    default
        The value specified by this option will be returned if the desired
        pillar key does not exist.

        If a default value is not specified, then it will be an empty string,
        unless :conf_minion:`pillar_raise_on_missing` is set to ``True``, in
        which case an error will be raised.

    merge : ``False``
        If ``True``, the retrieved values will be merged into the passed
        default. When the default and the retrieved value are both
        dictionaries, the dictionaries will be recursively merged.

        New in version 2014.7.0
        Changed in version 2016.3.7,2016.11.4,2017.7.0
            If the default and the retrieved value are not of the same type,
            then merging will be skipped and the retrieved value will be
            returned. Earlier releases raised an error in these cases.

    merge_nested_lists
        If set to ``False``, lists nested within the retrieved pillar
        dictionary will *overwrite* lists in ``default``. If set to ``True``,
        nested lists will be *merged* into lists in ``default``. If unspecified
        (the default), this option is inherited from the
        :conf_minion:`pillar_merge_lists` minion config option.

        Note:
            This option is ignored when ``merge`` is set to ``False``.

        New in version 2016.11.6

    delimiter
        Specify an alternate delimiter to use when traversing a nested dict.
        This is useful for when the desired key contains a colon. See CLI
        example below for usage.

        New in version 2014.7.0

    pillarenv
        If specified, this function will query the master to generate fresh
        pillar data on the fly, specifically from the requested pillar
        environment. Note that this can produce different pillar data than
        executing this function without an environment, as its normal behavior
        is just to return a value from minion's pillar data in memory (which
        can be sourced from more than one pillar environment).

        Using this argument will not affect the pillar data in memory. It will
        however be slightly slower and use more resources on the master due to
        the need for the master to generate and send the minion fresh pillar
        data. This tradeoff in performance however allows for the use case
        where pillar data is desired only from a single environment.

        New in version 2017.7.0

    saltenv
        Included only for compatibility with
        :conf_minion:`pillarenv_from_saltenv`, and is otherwise ignored.

        New in version 2017.7.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pillar.get pkg:apache
        salt '*' pillar.get abc::def|ghi delimiter='|'
    

pillar.file_exists:

    New in version 2016.3.0

    This is a master-only function. Calling from the minion is not supported.

    Use the given path and search relative to the pillar environments to see if
    a file exists at that path.

    If the ``saltenv`` argument is given, restrict search to that environment
    only.

    Will only work with ``pillar_roots``, not external pillars.

    Returns True if the file is found, and False otherwise.

    path
        The path to the file in question. Will be treated as a relative path

    saltenv
        Optional argument to restrict the search to a specific saltenv

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pillar.file_exists foo/bar.sls
    

pillar.filter_by:

    New in version 2017.7.0

    Look up the given pillar in a given dictionary and return the result

    :param lookup_dict: A dictionary, keyed by a pillar, containing a value or
        values relevant to systems matching that pillar. For example, a key
        could be a pillar for a role and the value could the name of a package
        on that particular OS.

        The dictionary key can be a globbing pattern. The function will return
        the corresponding ``lookup_dict`` value where the pillar value matches
        the  pattern. For example:

            # this will render 'got some salt' if ``role`` begins with 'salt'
            salt '*' pillar.filter_by '{salt*: got some salt, default: salt is not here}' role

    :param pillar: The name of a pillar to match with the system's pillar. For
        example, the value of the "role" pillar could be used to pull values
        from the ``lookup_dict`` dictionary.

        The pillar value can be a list. The function will return the
        ``lookup_dict`` value for a first found item in the list matching
        one of the ``lookup_dict`` keys.

    :param merge: A dictionary to merge with the results of the pillar
        selection from ``lookup_dict``. This allows another dictionary to
        override the values in the ``lookup_dict``.

    :param default: default lookup_dict's key used if the pillar does not exist
        or if the pillar value has no match on lookup_dict.  If unspecified
        the value is "default".

    :param base: A lookup_dict key to use for a base dictionary.  The
        pillar-selected ``lookup_dict`` is merged over this and then finally
        the ``merge`` dictionary is merged.  This allows common values for
        each case to be collected in the base and overridden by the pillar
        selection dictionary and the merge dictionary.  Default is unset.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pillar.filter_by '{web: Serve it up, db: I query, default: x_x}' role
    

pillar.get:

    New in version 0.14.0

    Attempt to retrieve the named value from :ref:`in-memory pillar data
    <pillar-in-memory>`. If the pillar key is not present in the in-memory
    pillar, then the value specified in the ``default`` option (described
    below) will be returned.

    If the merge parameter is set to ``True``, the default will be recursively
    merged into the returned pillar data.

    The value can also represent a value in a nested dict using a ":" delimiter
    for the dict. This means that if a dict in pillar looks like this::

        {'pkg': {'apache': 'httpd'}}

    To retrieve the value associated with the ``apache`` key in the ``pkg``
    dict this key can be passed as::

        pkg:apache

    key
        The pillar key to get value from

    default
        The value specified by this option will be returned if the desired
        pillar key does not exist.

        If a default value is not specified, then it will be an empty string,
        unless :conf_minion:`pillar_raise_on_missing` is set to ``True``, in
        which case an error will be raised.

    merge : ``False``
        If ``True``, the retrieved values will be merged into the passed
        default. When the default and the retrieved value are both
        dictionaries, the dictionaries will be recursively merged.

        New in version 2014.7.0
        Changed in version 2016.3.7,2016.11.4,2017.7.0
            If the default and the retrieved value are not of the same type,
            then merging will be skipped and the retrieved value will be
            returned. Earlier releases raised an error in these cases.

    merge_nested_lists
        If set to ``False``, lists nested within the retrieved pillar
        dictionary will *overwrite* lists in ``default``. If set to ``True``,
        nested lists will be *merged* into lists in ``default``. If unspecified
        (the default), this option is inherited from the
        :conf_minion:`pillar_merge_lists` minion config option.

        Note:
            This option is ignored when ``merge`` is set to ``False``.

        New in version 2016.11.6

    delimiter
        Specify an alternate delimiter to use when traversing a nested dict.
        This is useful for when the desired key contains a colon. See CLI
        example below for usage.

        :conf_minion:`pillarenv_from_saltenv`, and is otherwise ignored.

        New in version 2017.7.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pillar.get pkg:apache
        salt '*' pillar.get abc::def|ghi delimiter='|'
    

pillar.item:

    New in version 0.16.2

    Return one or more pillar entries from the :ref:`in-memory pillar data
    <pillar-in-memory>`.

    delimiter
        Delimiter used to traverse nested dictionaries.

        Note:
            This is different from :py:func:`pillar.get
            <salt.modules.pillar.get>` in that no default value can be
            specified. :py:func:`pillar.get <salt.modules.pillar.get>` should
            probably still be used in most cases to retrieve nested pillar
            values, as it is a bit more flexible. One reason to use this
            function instead of :py:func:`pillar.get <salt.modules.pillar.get>`
            however is when it is desirable to retrieve the values of more than
            one key, since :py:func:`pillar.get <salt.modules.pillar.get>` can
            only retrieve one key at a time.

        New in version 2015.8.0

    pillarenv
        If specified, this function will query the master to generate fresh
        pillar data on the fly, specifically from the requested pillar
        environment. Note that this can produce different pillar data than
        executing this function without an environment, as its normal behavior

    saltenv
        Included only for compatibility with
        :conf_minion:`pillarenv_from_saltenv`, and is otherwise ignored.

        New in version 2017.7.6,2018.3.1

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' pillar.item foo
        salt '*' pillar.item foo:bar
        salt '*' pillar.item foo bar baz
    

pillar.items:

    Calls the master for a fresh pillar and generates the pillar data on the
    fly

    Contrast with :py:func:`raw` which returns the pillar data that is
    currently loaded into the minion.

    pillar
        If specified, allows for a dictionary of pillar data to be made
        available to pillar and ext_pillar rendering. these pillar variables
        will also override any variables of the same name in pillar or
        ext_pillar.

        New in version 2015.5.0

    pillar_enc
        If specified, the data passed in the ``pillar`` argument will be passed
        through this renderer to decrypt it.

        Note:
            This will decrypt on the minion side, so the specified renderer
            must be set up on the minion for this to work. Alternatively,
            pillar data can be decrypted master-side. For more information, see
            the :ref:`Pillar Encryption <pillar-encryption>` documentation.
            Pillar data that is decrypted master-side, is not decrypted until
            the end of pillar compilation though, so minion-side decryption
            will be necessary if the encrypted pillar data must be made
            available in an decrypted state pillar/ext_pillar rendering.

        New in version 2017.7.0

    pillarenv
        Pass a specific pillar environment from which to compile pillar data.
        If not specified, then the minion's :conf_minion:`pillarenv` option is
        not used, and if that also is not specified then all configured pillar
        environments will be merged into a single pillar dictionary and
        returned.

        New in version 2016.11.2

    saltenv
        Included only for compatibility with

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pillar.items
    

pillar.keys:

    New in version 2015.8.0

    Attempt to retrieve a list of keys from the named value from the pillar.

    The value can also represent a value in a nested dict using a ":" delimiter
    for the dict, similar to how pillar.get works.

    delimiter
        Specify an alternate delimiter to use when traversing a nested dict

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pillar.keys web:sites
    

pillar.ls:

    New in version 2015.8.0

    Calls the master for a fresh pillar, generates the pillar data on the
    fly (same as :py:func:`items`), but only shows the available main keys.

    pillar
        If specified, allows for a dictionary of pillar data to be made
        available to pillar and ext_pillar rendering. these pillar variables
        will also override any variables of the same name in pillar or
        ext_pillar.

    pillar_enc

        not used, and if that also is not specified then all configured pillar
        environments will be merged into a single pillar dictionary and
        returned.

    saltenv
        Included only for compatibility with
        :conf_minion:`pillarenv_from_saltenv`, and is otherwise ignored.

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' pillar.ls
    

pillar.obfuscate:

    New in version 2015.8.0

    Same as :py:func:`items`, but replace pillar values with a simple type indication.

    This is useful to avoid displaying sensitive information on console or
    flooding the console with long output, such as certificates.
    For many debug or control purposes, the stakes lie more in dispatching than in
    actual values.

    In case the value is itself a collection type, obfuscation occurs within the value.
    For mapping types, keys are not obfuscated.
    Here are some examples:

    * ``'secret password'`` becomes ``'<str>'``
    * ``['secret', 1]`` becomes ``['<str>', '<int>']``
    * ``{'login': 'somelogin', 'pwd': 'secret'}`` becomes
      ``{'login': '<str>', 'pwd': '<str>'}``

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' pillar.obfuscate

    

pillar.raw:

    Return the raw pillar data that is currently loaded into the minion.

    Contrast with :py:func:`items` which calls the master to fetch the most
    up-to-date Pillar.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pillar.raw

    With the optional key argument, you can select a subtree of the
    pillar raw data.::

        salt '*' pillar.raw key='roles'
    

pip.freeze:

    Return a list of installed packages either globally or in the specified
    virtualenv

    bin_env
        Path to pip (or to a virtualenv). This can be used to specify the path
        to the pip to use when more than one Python release is installed (e.g.
        ``/usr/bin/pip-2.7`` or ``/usr/bin/pip-2.6``. If a directory path is
        specified, it is assumed to be a virtualenv.

    user
        The user under which to run pip

    cwd
        Directory from which to run pip

    Note:
        If the version of pip available is older than 8.0.3, the list will not
        include the packages ``pip``, ``wheel``, ``setuptools``, or
        ``distribute`` even if they are installed.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pip.freeze bin_env=/home/code/path/to/virtualenv
    

pip.install:

    Install packages with pip

    Install packages individually or from a pip requirements file. Install
    packages globally or to a virtualenv.

    pkgs
        Comma separated list of packages to install

    requirements
        Path to requirements

    bin_env
        Path to pip (or to a virtualenv). This can be used to specify the path
        to the pip to use when more than one Python release is installed (e.g.
        ``/usr/bin/pip-2.7`` or ``/usr/bin/pip-2.6``. If a directory path is
        specified, it is assumed to be a virtualenv.

        Note:

            For Windows, if the pip module is being used to upgrade the pip
            package, bin_env should be the path to the virtualenv or to the
            python binary that should be used.  The pip command is unable to
            upgrade itself in Windows.

    use_wheel
        Prefer wheel archives (requires pip>=1.4)

    no_use_wheel
        Force to not use wheel archives (requires pip>=1.4,<10.0.0)

    no_binary
        Force to not use binary packages (requires pip >= 7.0.0)
        Accepts either :all: to disable all binary packages, :none: to empty the set,
        or one or more package names with commas between them

    log
        Log file where a complete (maximum verbosity) record will be kept.
        If this file doesn't exist and the parent directory is writeable,
        it will be created.

    proxy
        Specify a proxy in the form ``user:passwd@proxy.server:port``. Note
        that the ``user:password@`` is optional and required only if you are
        behind an authenticated proxy. If you provide
        ``user@proxy.server:port`` then you will be prompted for a password.

        Note:
            If the Minion has a globaly configured proxy - it will be used
            even if no proxy was set here. To explicitly disable proxy for pip
            you should pass ``False`` as a value.

    timeout
        Set the socket timeout (default 15 seconds)

    editable
        install something editable (e.g.
        ``git+https://github.com/worldcompany/djangoembed.git#egg=djangoembed``)

    find_links
        URL to search for packages

    index_url
        Base URL of Python Package Index

    extra_index_url
        Extra URLs of package indexes to use in addition to ``index_url``

    no_index
        Ignore package index

    mirrors
        Specific mirror URL(s) to query (automatically adds --use-mirrors)

        Warning:

            This option has been deprecated and removed in pip version 7.0.0.
            Please use ``index_url`` and/or ``extra_index_url`` instead.

    build
        Unpack packages into ``build`` dir

    target
        Install packages into ``target`` dir

    download
        Download packages into ``download`` instead of installing them

    download_cache | cache_dir

    source
        Check out ``editable`` packages into ``source`` dir

    upgrade
        Upgrade all packages to the newest available version

    force_reinstall
        When upgrading, reinstall all packages even if they are already
        up-to-date.

    ignore_installed
        Ignore the installed packages (reinstalling instead)

    exists_action
        Default action when a path already exists: (s)witch, (i)gnore, (w)ipe,
        (b)ackup

    no_deps
        Ignore package dependencies

    no_install
        Download and unpack all packages, but don't actually install them

    no_download
        Don't download any packages, just install the ones already downloaded
        (completes an install run with ``--no-install``)

    install_options
        Extra arguments to be supplied to the setup.py install command (e.g.
        like ``--install-option='--install-scripts=/usr/local/bin'``).  Use
        multiple --install-option options to pass multiple options to setup.py
        install. If you are using an option with a directory path, be sure to
        use absolute path.

    global_options
        Extra global options to be supplied to the setup.py call before the
        install command.

    user

        Allow the installation of insecure and unverifiable files (comma
        separated list)

    process_dependency_links
        Enable the processing of dependency links

    env_vars
        Set environment variables that some builds will depend on. For example,
        a Python C-module may have a Makefile that needs INCLUDE_PATH set to
        pick up a header file while compiling.  This must be in the form of a
        dictionary or a mapping.

        Example:

            salt '*' pip.install django_app env_vars="{'CUSTOM_PATH': '/opt/django_app'}"

    trusted_host
        Mark this host as trusted, even though it does not have valid or any
        HTTPS.

            salt '*' pip.install pandas extra_args="[{'--latest-pip-kwarg':'param'}, '--latest-pip-arg']"

        Warning:

            If unsupported options are passed here that are not supported in a
            minion's version of pip, a `No such option error` will be thrown.

    Will be translated into the following pip command:

        pip install pandas --latest-pip-kwarg param --latest-pip-arg

    disable_version_check
        Pip may periodically check PyPI to determine whether a new version of
        pip is available to download. Passing True for this option disables
        that check.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pip.install <package name>,<package2 name>
        salt '*' pip.install requirements=/path/to/requirements.txt
        salt '*' pip.install <package name> bin_env=/path/to/virtualenv
        salt '*' pip.install <package name> bin_env=/path/to/pip_bin

    Complicated CLI Example:

        salt '*' pip.install markdown,django                 editable=git+https://github.com/worldcompany/djangoembed.git#egg=djangoembed upgrade=True no_deps=True

    

pip.is_installed:

    New in version 2018.3.0
    Changed in version 3006.0

    Filter list of installed modules and return True if ``pkgname`` exists in
    the list of packages installed.

    CLI Example:

pip.list:

    Changed in version 3006.0

    Output list of installed apps from ``pip list`` in JSON format and check to
    see if ``prefix`` exists in the list of packages installed.

    Note:

        If the version of pip available is older than 9.0.0, parsing the
        ``freeze`` function output will be used to determine the name and
        version of installed modules.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pip.list salt
    

pip.list_all_versions:

    New in version 2017.7.3

    List all available versions of a pip package

    pkg
        The package to check

    bin_env
        Path to pip (or to a virtualenv). This can be used to specify the path
        to the pip to use when more than one Python release is installed (e.g.
        ``/usr/bin/pip-2.7`` or ``/usr/bin/pip-2.6``. If a directory path is
        specified, it is assumed to be a virtualenv.

    include_alpha
        Include alpha versions in the list

    include_beta
        Include beta versions in the list

    New in version 3006.0

    Filter list of installed apps from ``freeze`` and check to see if
    ``prefix`` exists in the list of packages installed.

    Note:

        If the version of pip available is older than 8.0.3, the packages
        ``wheel``, ``setuptools``, and ``distribute`` will not be reported by
        this function even if they are installed. Unlike :py:func:`pip.freeze
        <salt.modules.pip.freeze>`, this function always reports the version of
        pip which is installed.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pip.list_freeze_parse salt

        to the pip to use when more than one Python release is installed (e.g.
        ``/usr/bin/pip-2.7`` or ``/usr/bin/pip-2.6``. If a directory path is
        specified, it is assumed to be a virtualenv.

    log
        Log file where a complete (maximum verbosity) record will be kept

    proxy
        Specify a proxy in the format ``user:passwd@proxy.server:port``. Note
        that the ``user:password@`` is optional and required only if you are
        behind an authenticated proxy.  If you provide
        ``user@proxy.server:port`` then you will be prompted for a password.

        Note:
            If the Minion has a globaly configured proxy - it will be used
            even if no proxy was set here. To explicitly disable proxy for pip
            you should pass ``False`` as a value.

    timeout
        Set the socket timeout (default 15 seconds)

        {'<package>':  {'old': '<old-version>',
                        'new': '<new-version>'}}

    CLI Example:

pkg.install:

    Changed in version 2015.8.12,2016.3.3,2016.11.0
        On minions running systemd>=205, `systemd-run(1)`_ is now used to
        isolate commands which modify installed packages from the
        ``salt-minion`` daemon's control group. This is done to keep systemd
        from killing any apt-get/dpkg commands spawned by Salt when the
        ``salt-minion`` service is restarted. (see ``KillMode`` in the
        `systemd.kill(5)`_ manpage for more information). If desired, usage of
        `systemd-run(1)`_ can be suppressed by setting a :mod:`config option
        <salt.modules.config.get>` called ``systemd.scope``, with a value of
        ``False`` (no quotes).

    .. _`systemd-run(1)`: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-run.html
    .. _`systemd.kill(5)`: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.kill.html

    Install the passed package, add refresh=True to update the dpkg database.

    name
        The name of the package to be installed. Note that this parameter is
        ignored if either "pkgs" or "sources" is passed. Additionally, please
        note that this option can only be used to install packages from a
        software repository. To install a package file manually, use the
        "sources" option.

        32-bit packages can be installed on 64-bit systems by appending the
        architecture designation (``:i386``, etc.) to the end of the package
        name.

        CLI Example:

            salt '*' pkg.install <package name>

    refresh
        Whether or not to refresh the package database before installing.

    cache_valid_time

        New in version 2016.11.0

            version can now contain comparison operators (e.g. ``>1.2.3``,
            ``<=2.0``, etc.)

    reinstall : False
        Specifying reinstall=True will use ``apt-get install --reinstall``
        rather than simply ``apt-get install`` for requested packages that are
        already installed.

        If a version is specified with the requested package, then ``apt-get
        install --reinstall`` will only be used if the installed version
        matches the requested version.

        New in version 2015.8.0

    ignore_epoch : False
        Only used when the version of a package is specified using a comparison
        operator (e.g. ``>4.1``). If set to ``True``, then the epoch will be
        ignored when comparing the currently-installed version to the desired
        version.

    sources
        A list of DEB packages to install. Must be passed as a list of dicts,
        with the keys being package names, and the values being the source URI
        or local path to the package.  Dependencies are automatically resolved
        and marked as auto-installed.

        32-bit packages can be installed on 64-bit systems by appending the
        architecture designation (``:i386``, etc.) to the end of the package
        name.

        Changed in version 2014.7.0

        CLI Example:

            salt '*' pkg.install sources='[{"foo": "salt://foo.deb"},{"bar": "salt://bar.deb"}]'

    purge_desired
        If ``True``, then only packages which have been marked to be purged,
        but can't be purged due to their status as dependencies for other
        installed packages, will be returned. Note that these packages will
        appear in installed

        Changed in version 2014.1.1

            Packages in this state now correctly show up in the output of this
            function.

        into a single string and appended to the repo configuration with a
        comment marker (#) before it.

        New in version 2015.8.9

    refresh : True
        Enable or disable (True or False) refreshing of the apt package
        database. The previous ``refresh_db`` argument was deprecated in
        favor of ``refresh```. The ``refresh_db`` argument will still
        continue to work to ensure backwards compatibility, but please
        change to using the preferred ``refresh``.

    Note:
        Due to the way keys are stored for APT, there is a known issue where
        the key won't be updated unless another change is made at the same
        time. Keys should be properly added on initial configuration.

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' pkg.mod_repo 'myrepo definition' uri=http://new/uri
        salt '*' pkg.mod_repo 'myrepo definition' comps=main,universe
    

pkg.normalize_name:

    Strips the architecture from the specified package name, if necessary.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pkg.normalize_name zsh:amd64
    

pkg.owner:

    New in version 2014.7.0

    Return the name of the package that owns the file. Multiple file paths can
    be passed. Like :mod:`pkg.version <salt.modules.aptpkg.version>`, if a
    single path is passed, a string will be returned, and if multiple paths are
    passed, a dictionary of file/package name pairs will be returned.

    If the file is not owned by a package, or is not present on the minion,
    then an empty string will be returned for that path.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pkg.owner /usr/bin/apachectl
        salt '*' pkg.owner /usr/bin/apachectl /usr/bin/basename
    

pkg.parse_arch:

    Parse name and architecture from the specified package name.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pkg.parse_arch zsh:amd64
    

pkg.purge:

    Changed in version 2015.8.12,2016.3.3,2016.11.0
        On minions running systemd>=205, `systemd-run(1)`_ is now used to
        isolate commands which modify installed packages from the
        ``salt-minion`` daemon's control group. This is done to keep systemd
        from killing any apt-get/dpkg commands spawned by Salt when the
        ``salt-minion`` service is restarted. (see ``KillMode`` in the
        `systemd.kill(5)`_ manpage for more information). If desired, usage of
        `systemd-run(1)`_ can be suppressed by setting a :mod:`config option
        <salt.modules.config.get>` called ``systemd.scope``, with a value of
        ``False`` (no quotes).

    .. _`systemd-run(1)`: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-run.html

        salt '*' pkg.purge <package1>,<package2>,<package3>
        salt '*' pkg.purge pkgs='["foo", "bar"]'
    

pkg.refresh_db:

    Updates the APT database to latest packages based upon repositories

    Returns a dict, with the keys being package databases and the values being
    the result of the update attempt. Values can be one of the following:

    - ``True``: Database updated successfully
    - ``False``: Problem updating database
    - ``None``: Database already up-to-date

    cache_valid_time

        New in version 2016.11.0

        Skip refreshing the package database if refresh has already occurred within
        <value> seconds

    failhard

        If False, return results of Err lines as ``False`` for the package database that
        encountered the error.
        If True, raise an error with a list of the package databases that encountered
        errors.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pkg.refresh_db
    

pkg.remove:

    Changed in version 2015.8.12,2016.3.3,2016.11.0

    name
        The name of the package to be deleted.


    Multiple Package Options:

    pkgs
        A list of packages to delete. Must be passed as a python list. The
        ``name`` parameter will be ignored if this option is passed.

    New in version 0.16.0


    Returns a dict containing the changes.

pkg.services_need_restart:

    New in version 3003

    List services that use files which have been changed by the
    package manager. It might be needed to restart them.

    Requires checkrestart from the debian-goodies package.

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' pkg.services_need_restart
    

pkg.set_selections:

    Change package state in the dpkg database.

    The state can be any one of, documented in ``dpkg(1)``:

    - install
    - hold
    - deinstall
    - purge

    This command is commonly used to mark specific packages to be held from
    being upgraded, that is, to be kept at a certain version. When a state is
    changed to anything but being held, then it is typically followed by
    ``apt-get -u dselect-upgrade``.

    Note: Be careful with the ``clear`` argument, since it will start
    with setting all packages to deinstall state.

    Returns a dict of dicts containing the package names, and the new and old
    versions:

        {'<host>':
            {'<package>': {'new': '<new-state>',
                           'old': '<old-state>'}
            },
            ...
        }

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pkg.set_selections selection='{"install": ["netcat"]}'
        salt '*' pkg.set_selections selection='{"hold": ["openssh-server", "openssh-client"]}'
        salt '*' pkg.set_selections salt://path/to/file
        salt '*' pkg.set_selections salt://path/to/file clear=True
    

pkg.show:

    New in version 2019.2.0

    Runs an ``apt-cache show`` on the passed package names, and returns the
    results in a nested dictionary. The top level of the return data will be
    the package name, with each package name mapping to a dictionary of version
    numbers to any additional information returned by ``apt-cache show``.

    filter
        An optional comma-separated list (or quoted Python list) of
        case-insensitive keys on which to filter. This allows one to restrict
        the information returned for each package to a smaller selection of
        pertinent items.

    refresh : False
        If ``True``, the apt cache will be refreshed first. By default, no
        refresh is performed.

    CLI Examples:

        salt myminion pkg.show gawk
        salt myminion pkg.show 'nginx-*'
        salt myminion pkg.show 'nginx-*' filter=description,provides
    

pkg.unhold:

    New in version 2014.7.0

    Set package current in 'hold' state to install state,
    meaning it will be upgraded.

        CLI Example:

            salt '*' pkg.unhold <package name>

    pkgs
        A list of packages to unhold. Must be passed as a python list.

        CLI Example:

            salt '*' pkg.unhold pkgs='["foo", "bar"]'
    

pkg.upgrade:

    Changed in version 2015.8.12,2016.3.3,2016.11.0
        On minions running systemd>=205, `systemd-run(1)`_ is now used to
        isolate commands which modify installed packages from the
        ``salt-minion`` daemon's control group. This is done to keep systemd
        from killing any apt-get/dpkg commands spawned by Salt when the
        ``salt-minion`` service is restarted. (see ``KillMode`` in the
        `systemd.kill(5)`_ manpage for more information). If desired, usage of
        `systemd-run(1)`_ can be suppressed by setting a :mod:`config option
        <salt.modules.config.get>` called ``systemd.scope``, with a value of
        ``False`` (no quotes).

    .. _`systemd.kill(5)`: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.kill.html

    Upgrades all packages via ``apt-get upgrade`` or ``apt-get dist-upgrade``
    if  ``dist_upgrade`` is ``True``.

    Returns a dictionary containing the changes:

                        'new': '<new-version>'}}

    dist_upgrade
        Whether to perform the upgrade using dist-upgrade vs upgrade.  Default
        is to use upgrade.

        New in version 2014.7.0

    refresh : True
        If ``True``, the apt cache will be refreshed first. By default,
        this is ``True`` and a refresh is performed.

    cache_valid_time

        New in version 2016.11.0

        Skip refreshing the package database if refresh has already occurred within
        <value> seconds

    download_only (or downloadonly)
        Only download the packages, don't unpack or install them. Use
        downloadonly to be in line with yum and zypper module.

        New in version 2018.3.0

    Check whether or not an upgrade is available for a given package

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pkg.upgrade_available <package name>
    

pkg.version:

    Returns a string representing the package version or an empty string if not
    installed. If more than one package name is specified, a dict of
    name/version pairs is returned.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pkg.version <package name>
        salt '*' pkg.version <package1> <package2> <package3> ...
    

pkg.version_cmp:

    Do a cmp-style comparison on two packages. Return -1 if pkg1 < pkg2, 0 if
    pkg1 == pkg2, and 1 if pkg1 > pkg2. Return None if there was a problem
    making the comparison.

    ignore_epoch : False
        Set to ``True`` to ignore the epoch when comparing versions

        New in version 2015.8.10,2016.3.2

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pkg.version_cmp '0.2.4-0ubuntu1' '0.2.4.1-0ubuntu1'
    

pkg_resource.add_pkg:

    Add a package to a dict of installed packages.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pkg_resource.add_pkg '{}' bind 9
    

pkg_resource.check_extra_requirements:

    Check if the installed package already has the given requirements.
    This function will return the result of ``pkg.check_extra_requirements`` if
    this function exists for the minion, otherwise it will return True.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pkg_resource.check_extra_requirements <pkgname> <extra_requirements>

    the key/value pairs into a single dict.

    ``'[{"foo": "salt://foo.rpm"}, {"bar": "salt://bar.rpm"}]'`` would become
    ``{"foo": "salt://foo.rpm", "bar": "salt://bar.rpm"}``

    normalize : True
        Normalize the package name by removing the architecture, if the
        architecture of the package is different from the architecture of the
        operating system. The ability to disable this behavior is useful for
        poorly-created packages which include the architecture as an actual
        part of the name, such as kernel modules which match a specific kernel
        version.

        New in version 2015.8.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pkg_resource.pack_sources '[{"foo": "salt://foo.rpm"}, {"bar": "salt://bar.rpm"}]'
    

pkg_resource.parse_targets:

    Parses the input to pkg.install and returns back the package(s) to be

    the packages are to come from a repository or a binary package.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pkg_resource.parse_targets
    

pkg_resource.sort_pkglist:

    Accepts a dict obtained from pkg.list_pkgs() and sorts in place the list of
    versions for any packages that have multiple versions installed, so that
    two package lists can be compared to one another.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pkg_resource.sort_pkglist '["3.45", "2.13"]'
    

pkg_resource.stringify:

    Takes a dict of package name/version information and joins each list of
    installed versions into a string.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pkg_resource.stringify 'vim: 7.127'
    

pkg_resource.version:

    Common interface for obtaining the version of installed packages.

        salt '*' pkg_resource.version 'python*'
    

pkg_resource.version_clean:

    Clean the version string removing extra data.
    This function will simply try to call ``pkg.version_clean``.

pkg_resource.version_compare:

    New in version 3001

    Perform a version comparison, using (where available) platform-specific
    version comparison tools to make the comparison.

    ver1

    oper
        One of `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`

    ver2
        The second version to be compared

    Note:
        To avoid shell interpretation, each of the above values should be
        quoted when this function is used on the CLI.

    ignore_epoch : False
        If ``True``, both package versions will have their epoch prefix
        stripped before comparison.

    This function is useful in Jinja templates, to perform specific actions
    when a package's version meets certain criteria. For example:

        {%- set postfix_version = salt.pkg.version('postfix') %}
        {%- if postfix_version and salt.pkg_resource.version_compare(postfix_version, '>=', '3.3', ignore_epoch=True) %}
          {#- do stuff #}
        {%- endif %}

    CLI Examples:

        salt myminion pkg_resource.version_compare '3.5' '<=' '2.4'
        salt myminion pkg_resource.version_compare '3.5' '<=' '2.4' ignore_epoch=True
    

postfix.delete:

    Delete message(s) from the mail queue

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' postfix.delete 5C33CA0DEA

        salt '*' postfix.delete ALL

    

postfix.hold:

    Put message(s) on hold from the mail queue

        salt '*' postfix.hold 5C33CA0DEA

        salt '*' postfix.hold ALL

    

postfix.requeue:

    Requeue message(s) in the mail queue

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' postfix.requeue 5C33CA0DEA

        salt '*' postfix.requeue ALL

    

postfix.set_main:

    Set a single config value in the main.cf file. If the value does not already
    exist, it will be appended to the end.

    CLI Example:

        salt <minion> postfix.set_main mailq_path /usr/bin/mailq
    

postfix.set_master:

    Set a single config value in the master.cf file. If the value does not
    already exist, it will be appended to the end.

    Because of shell parsing issues, '-' cannot be set as a value, as is normal
    in the master.cf file; either 'y', 'n' or a number should be used when
    calling this function from the command line. If the value used matches the
    default, it will internally be converted to a '-'. Calling this function
    from the Python API is not affected by this limitation

    The settings and their default values, in order, are: service (required),
    conn_type (required), private (y), unpriv (y), chroot (y), wakeup (n),
    maxproc (100), command (required).

    By default, this function will write out the changes to the master.cf file,
    and then returns the full contents of the file. By setting the
    ``write_conf`` option to ``False``, it will skip writing the file.

    CLI Example:

        salt <minion> postfix.set_master smtp inet n y n n 100 smtpd
    

postfix.show_main:

    Return a dict of active config values. This does not include comments,
    spacing or order. Bear in mind that order is functionally important in the
    main.cf file, since keys can be referred to as variables. This means that
    the data returned from this function should not be used for direct
    modification of the main.cf file; other functions are available for that.

    CLI Examples:

        salt <minion> postfix.show_main
        salt <minion> postfix.show_main path=/path/to/main.cf
    

postfix.show_master:

    Return a dict of active config values. This does not include comments,
    spacing or order.

    The data returned from this function should not be used for direct
    modification of the main.cf file; other functions are available for that.

    CLI Examples:

        salt <minion> postfix.show_master
        salt <minion> postfix.show_master path=/path/to/master.cf
    

postfix.show_queue:

    Show contents of the mail queue

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' postfix.show_queue

    

postfix.unhold:

    Set held message(s) in the mail queue to unheld

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' postfix.unhold 5C33CA0DEA

        salt '*' postfix.unhold ALL

    

ps.boot_time:

    Return the boot time in number of seconds since the epoch began.

    CLI Example:

    time_format
        Optionally specify a `strftime`_ format string. Use
        ``time_format='%c'`` to get a nicely-formatted locale specific date and
        time (i.e. ``Fri May  2 19:08:32 2014``).

        .. _strftime: https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' ps.cpu_percent
    

ps.cpu_times:

    Return the percent of time the CPU spends in each state,
    e.g. user, system, idle, nice, iowait, irq, softirq.

    per_cpu

    CLI Example:

        salt system.example.com publish.full_data '*' cmd.run 'ls -la /tmp'

    .. admonition:: Attention

        If you need to pass a value to a function argument and that value
        contains an equal sign, you **must** include the argument name.
        For example:

            salt '*' publish.full_data test.kwarg arg='cheese=spam'

    

publish.publish:

    Publish a command from the minion out to other minions.

    Publications need to be enabled on the Salt master and the minion
    needs to have permission to publish the command. The Salt master
    will also prevent a recursive publication loop, this means that a
    minion cannot command another minion to command another minion as
    that would create an infinite command loop.

    The ``tgt_type`` argument is used to pass a target other than a glob into
    the execution, the available options are:

    - glob
    - pcre
    - grain
    - grain_pcre
    - pillar
    - pillar_pcre
    - ipcidr
    - range
    - compound

    Changed in version 2017.7.0
        The ``expr_form`` argument has been renamed to ``tgt_type``, earlier
        releases must use ``expr_form``.

    Note that for pillar matches must be exact, both in the pillar matcher
    and the compound matcher. No globbing is supported.

    The arguments sent to the minion publish function are separated with
    commas. This means that for a minion executing a command with multiple
    args it will look like this:

        salt system.example.com publish.publish '*' user.add 'foo,1020,1020'
        salt system.example.com publish.publish 'os:Fedora' network.interfaces '' grain

    CLI Example:

        salt system.example.com publish.publish '*' cmd.run 'ls -la /tmp'


    .. admonition:: Attention

        If you need to pass a value to a function argument and that value
        contains an equal sign, you **must** include the argument name.
        For example:

            salt '*' publish.publish test.kwarg arg='cheese=spam'

        Multiple keyword arguments should be passed as a list.

            salt '*' publish.publish test.kwarg arg="['cheese=spam','spam=cheese']"


    When running via salt-call, the `via_master` flag may be set to specific which
    master the publication should be sent to. Only one master may be specified. If
    unset, the publication will be sent only to the first master in minion configuration.

    :param sound:       The sound to associate with the message.
    :param api_version: The PushOver API version, if not specified in the configuration.
    :param token:       The PushOver token, if not specified in the configuration.
    :return:            Boolean if message was sent successfully.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' pushover.post_message user='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' title='Message from Salt' message='Build is done'

        salt '*' pushover.post_message user='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' title='Message from Salt' message='Build is done' priority='2' expire='720' retry='5'

        New in version 3007.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' saltcheck.run_state_tests postfix,common

    Tests will be run in parallel by adding "saltcheck_parallel: True" in minion config.
    When enabled, saltcheck will use up to the number of cores detected. This can be limited
    by setting the "saltcheck_processes" value to an integer to set the maximum number
    of parallel processes.

saltutil.clear_cache:

    Forcibly removes all caches on a minion.

    New in version 2014.7.0

    WARNING: The safest way to clear a minion cache is by first stopping
    the minion and then deleting the cache files before restarting it.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' saltutil.clear_cache
    

saltutil.clear_job_cache:

    Forcibly removes job cache folders and files on a minion.

    New in version 2018.3.0

    WARNING: The safest way to clear a minion cache is by first stopping
    the minion and then deleting the cache files before restarting it.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' saltutil.clear_job_cache hours=12
    

saltutil.cmd:

    Changed in version 2017.7.0
        The ``expr_form`` argument has been renamed to ``tgt_type``, earlier
        releases must use ``expr_form``.

    Assuming this minion is a master, execute a salt command

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' saltutil.cmd
    

saltutil.cmd_iter:

    Changed in version 2017.7.0
        The ``expr_form`` argument has been renamed to ``tgt_type``, earlier
        releases must use ``expr_form``.

    Assuming this minion is a master, execute a salt command

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' saltutil.cmd_iter
    

saltutil.find_cached_job:

    Return the data for a specific cached job id. Note this only works if
    cache_jobs has previously been set to True on the minion.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' saltutil.find_cached_job <job id>
    

saltutil.find_job:

    Return the data for a specific job id that is currently running.

    jid
        The job id to search for and return data.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' saltutil.find_job <job id>

    Note that the find_job function only returns job information when the job is still running. If
    the job is currently running, the output looks something like this:

        # salt my-minion saltutil.find_job 20160503150049487736
        my-minion:
            ----------
            arg:
                - 30
            fun:
                test.sleep
            jid:
                20160503150049487736
            pid:
                9601
            ret:
            tgt:
                my-minion
            tgt_type:
                glob
            user:
                root

    If the job has already completed, the job cannot be found and therefore the function returns
    an empty dictionary, which looks like this on the CLI:

        # salt my-minion saltutil.find_job 20160503150049487736
        my-minion:
            ----------

        When ``refresh`` is set to ``True``, this module's cache containing
        the environments from which extension modules are synced when
        ``saltenv`` is not specified will be refreshed.

    Changed in version 2015.8.11,2016.3.2

service.masked:

    New in version 2015.8.0
    Changed in version 2015.8.5
        The return data for this function has changed. If the service is
        masked, the return value will now be the output of the ``systemctl
        is-enabled`` command (so that a persistent mask can be distinguished
        from a runtime mask). If the service is not masked, then ``False`` will
        be returned.
    Changed in version 2017.7.0
        This function now returns a boolean telling the user whether a mask
        specified by the new ``runtime`` argument is set. If ``runtime`` is
        ``False``, this function will return ``True`` if an indefinite mask is
        set for the named service (otherwise ``False`` will be returned). If
        ``runtime`` is ``False``, this function will return ``True`` if a
        runtime mask is set, otherwise ``False``.

    Check whether or not a service is masked

    runtime : False
        Set to ``True`` to check for a runtime mask

        New in version 2017.7.0
            In previous versions, this function would simply return the output
            of ``systemctl is-enabled`` when the service was found to be
            masked. However, since it is possible to both have both indefinite
            and runtime masks on a service simultaneously, this function now
            only checks for runtime masks if this argument is set to ``True``.
            Otherwise, it will check for an indefinite mask.

    root
        Enable/disable/mask unit files in the specified root directory

        salt '*' service.masked foo
        salt '*' service.masked foo runtime=True
    

service.missing:

    New in version 2014.1.0

    The inverse of :py:func:`service.available

slsutil.banner:

    Create a standardized comment block to include in a templated file.

    A common technique in configuration management is to include a comment
    block in managed files, warning users not to modify the file. This
    function simplifies and standardizes those comment blocks.

    :param width: The width, in characters, of the banner. Default is 72.
    :param commentchar: The character to be used in the starting position of
        each line. This value should be set to a valid line comment character
        for the syntax of the file in which the banner is being inserted.
        Multiple character sequences, like '//' are supported.
        If the file's syntax does not support line comments (such as XML),
        use the ``blockstart`` and ``blockend`` options.
    :param borderchar: The character to use in the top and bottom border of
        the comment box. Must be a single character.
    :param blockstart: The character sequence to use at the beginning of a
        block comment. Should be used in conjunction with ``blockend``
    :param blockend: The character sequence to use at the end of a
        block comment. Should be used in conjunction with ``blockstart``
    :param title: The first field of the comment block. This field appears
        centered at the top of the box.
    :param text: The second filed of the comment block. This field appears
        left-justified at the bottom of the box.
    :param newline: Boolean value to indicate whether the comment block should
        end with a newline. Default is ``False``.

    **Example 1 - the default banner:**

        {{ salt['slsutil.banner']() }}

slsutil.boolstr:

    Convert a boolean value into a string. This function is
    intended to be used from within file templates to provide
    an easy way to take boolean values stored in Pillars or
    Grains, and write them out in the appropriate syntax for
    a particular file template.

    :param value: The boolean value to be converted
    :param true: The value to return if ``value`` is ``True``
    :param false: The value to return if ``value`` is ``False``

    In this example, a pillar named ``smtp:encrypted`` stores a boolean
    value, but the template that uses that value needs ``yes`` or ``no``
    to be written, based on the boolean value.

    *Note: this is written on two lines for clarity. The same result
    could be achieved in one line.*

        {% set encrypted = salt[pillar.get]('smtp:encrypted', false) %}
        use_tls: {{ salt['slsutil.boolstr'](encrypted, 'yes', 'no') }}

    Result (assuming the value is ``True``):

        use_tls: yes

slsutil.renderer:

    Parse a string or file through Salt's renderer system

    Changed in version 2018.3.0
       Add support for Salt fileserver URIs.

    This is an open-ended function and can be used for a variety of tasks. It
    makes use of Salt's "renderer pipes" system to run a string or file through
    a pipe of any of the loaded renderer modules.

    :param path: The path to a file on Salt's fileserver (any URIs supported by
        :py:func:`cp.get_url <salt.modules.cp.get_url>`) or on the local file
        system.
    :param string: An inline string to be used as the file to send through the
        renderer system. Note, not all renderer modules can work with strings;
        the 'py' renderer requires a file, for example.
    :param default_renderer: The renderer pipe to send the file through; this
        is overridden by a "she-bang" at the top of the file.
    :param kwargs: Keyword args to pass to Salt's compile_template() function.

    Keep in mind the goal of each renderer when choosing a render-pipe; for
    example, the Jinja renderer processes a text file and produces a string,
    however the YAML renderer processes a text file and produces a data
    structure.

    One possible use is to allow writing "map files", as are commonly seen in
    Salt formulas, but without tying the renderer of the map file to the
    renderer used in the other sls files. In other words, a map file could use
    the Python renderer and still be included and used by an sls file that uses
    the default 'jinja|yaml' renderer.

    For example, the two following map files produce identical results but one
    is written using the normal 'jinja|yaml' and the other is using 'py':

        #!jinja|yaml
        {% set apache = salt.grains.filter_by({
            ...normal jinja map file here...
        }, merge=salt.pillar.get('apache:lookup')) %}
        {{ apache | yaml() }}

        #!py
        def run():
            apache = __salt__.grains.filter_by({
                ...normal map here but as a python dict...
            }, merge=__salt__.pillar.get('apache:lookup'))
            return apache

    Regardless of which of the above map files is used, it can be accessed from
    any other sls file by calling this function. The following is a usage
    example in Jinja:

        {% set apache = salt.slsutil.renderer('map.sls') %}

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' slsutil.renderer salt://path/to/file
        salt '*' slsutil.renderer /path/to/file
        salt '*' slsutil.renderer /path/to/file.jinja default_renderer='jinja'
        salt '*' slsutil.renderer /path/to/file.sls default_renderer='jinja|yaml'
        salt '*' slsutil.renderer string='Inline template! {{ saltenv }}'
        salt '*' slsutil.renderer string='Hello, {{ name }}.' name='world'
    

slsutil.serialize:

    Serialize a Python object using one of the available
    :ref:`all-salt.serializers`.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' --no-parse=obj slsutil.serialize 'json' obj="{'foo': 'Foo!'}

    Jinja Example:

        {% set json_string = salt.slsutil.serialize('json',
            {'foo': 'Foo!'}) %}
    

slsutil.update:

    Merge ``upd`` recursively into ``dest``

    If ``merge_lists=True``, will aggregate list object types instead of
    replacing. This behavior is only activated when ``recursive_update=True``.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' slsutil.update '{foo: Foo}' '{bar: Bar}'

    

smbios.get:

        salt '*' ssh.host_keys keydir=/etc/ssh private=False
        salt '*' ssh.host_keys keydir=/etc/ssh certs=False
    

ssh.key_is_encrypted:

    New in version 2015.8.7

    Function to determine whether or not a private key is encrypted with a

        and the host in question considered unavailable.  Default is 5 seconds.

    fingerprint_hash_type
        The fingerprint hash type that the public key fingerprints were
        originally hashed with. This defaults to ``sha256`` if not specified.

ssh.rm_known_host:

    Remove all keys belonging to hostname from a known_hosts file.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' ssh.rm_known_host <user> <hostname>
    

ssh.set_auth_key:

    Add a key to the authorized_keys file. The "key" parameter must only be the
    string of text that is the encoded key. If the key begins with "ssh-rsa"
    or ends with user@host, remove those from the key before passing it to this
    function.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' ssh.set_auth_key <user> '<key>' enc='dsa'
    

ssh.set_auth_key_from_file:

    Add a key to the authorized_keys file, using a file as the source.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' ssh.set_auth_key_from_file <user> salt://ssh_keys/<user>.id_rsa.pub
    

ssh.set_known_host:

    Download SSH public key from remote host "hostname", optionally validate
    its fingerprint against "fingerprint" variable and save the record in the
    known_hosts file.

    If such a record does already exists in there, do nothing.

    user
        The user who owns the ssh authorized keys file to modify

    hostname
        The name of the remote host (e.g. "github.com")

    fingerprint
        The fingerprint of the key which must be present in the known_hosts
        file (optional if key specified)

    key
        The public key which must be presented in the known_hosts file
        (optional if fingerprint specified)

    port
        optional parameter, denoting the port of the remote host, which will be
        used in case, if the public key will be requested from it. By default
        the port 22 is used.

    enc
        Defines what type of key is being used, can be ed25519, ecdsa,
        ssh-rsa, ssh-dss or any other type as of openssh server version 8.7.

    config
        The location of the authorized keys file relative to the user's home
        directory, defaults to ".ssh/known_hosts". If no user is specified,
        defaults to "/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts". If present, must be an
        absolute path when a user is not specified.

    hash_known_hosts : True
        Hash all hostnames and addresses in the known hosts file.

    timeout : int
        Set the timeout for connection attempts.  If ``timeout`` seconds have
        elapsed since a connection was initiated to a host or since the last
        time anything was read from that host, then the connection is closed
        and the host in question considered unavailable.  Default is 5 seconds.

        New in version 2016.3.0

    fingerprint_hash_type
        The public key fingerprint hash type that the public key fingerprint
        was originally hashed with. This defaults to ``sha256`` if not specified.

        New in version 2016.11.4
        Changed in version 2017.7.0

            default changed from ``md5`` to ``sha256``

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' ssh.set_known_host <user> fingerprint='xx:xx:..:xx' enc='ssh-rsa' config='.ssh/known_hosts'
    

ssh.user_keys:

    Return the user's ssh keys on the minion

    New in version 2014.7.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' ssh.user_keys
        salt '*' ssh.user_keys user=user1
        salt '*' ssh.user_keys user=user1 pubfile=/home/user1/.ssh/id_rsa.pub prvfile=/home/user1/.ssh/id_rsa
        salt '*' ssh.user_keys user=user1 prvfile=False
        salt '*' ssh.user_keys user="['user1','user2'] pubfile=id_rsa.pub prvfile=id_rsa

    As you can see you can tell Salt not to read from the user's private (or
    public) key file by setting the file path to ``False``. This can be useful
    to prevent Salt from publishing private data via Salt Mine or others.
    

state.apply:

    New in version 2015.5.0

    This function will call :mod:`state.highstate
    <salt.modules.state.highstate>` or :mod:`state.sls
    <salt.modules.state.sls>` based on the arguments passed to this function.
    It exists as a more intuitive way of applying states.

    .. rubric:: APPLYING ALL STATES CONFIGURED IN TOP.SLS (A.K.A. :ref:`HIGHSTATE <running-highstate>`)

    To apply all configured states, simply run ``state.apply`` with no SLS
    targets, like so:

        salt '*' state.apply

    The following additional arguments are also accepted when applying all
    states configured in top.sls:

    test
        Run states in test-only (dry-run) mode

    mock
        The mock option allows for the state run to execute without actually
        calling any states. This then returns a mocked return which will show
        the requisite ordering as well as fully validate the state run.

        New in version 2015.8.4

    pillar
        Custom Pillar values, passed as a dictionary of key-value pairs

            salt '*' state.apply stuff pillar='{"foo": "bar"}'

        Note:
            Values passed this way will override Pillar values set via
            ``pillar_roots`` or an external Pillar source.

    exclude
        Exclude specific states from execution. Accepts a list of sls names, a
        comma-separated string of sls names, or a list of dictionaries
        containing ``sls`` or ``id`` keys. Glob-patterns may be used to match
        multiple states.

            salt '*' state.apply exclude=bar,baz
            salt '*' state.apply exclude=foo*
            salt '*' state.apply exclude="[{'id': 'id_to_exclude'}, {'sls': 'sls_to_exclude'}]"

    queue : False
        Instead of failing immediately when another state run is in progress,
        a value of ``True`` will queue the new state run to begin running once
        the other has finished.

        This option starts a new thread for each queued state run, so use this
        option sparingly.

        Changed in version 3006.0
            This parameter can also be set via the ``state_queue`` configuration
            option. Additionally, it can now be set to an integer representing
            the maximum queue size which can be attained before the state runs
            will fail to be queued. This can prevent runaway conditions where
            new threads are started until system performance is hampered.

    localconfig
        Optionally, instead of using the minion config, load minion opts from
        the file specified by this argument, and then merge them with the
        options from the minion config. This functionality allows for specific
        states to be run with their own custom minion configuration, including
        different pillars, file_roots, etc.

            salt '*' state.apply localconfig=/path/to/minion.yml

    state_events
        The state_events option sends progress events as each function in
        a state run completes execution.

        New in version 3006.0


    .. rubric:: APPLYING INDIVIDUAL SLS FILES (A.K.A. :py:func:`STATE.SLS <salt.modules.state.sls>`)

    To apply individual SLS files, pass them as a comma-separated list:

        # Run the states configured in salt://stuff.sls (or salt://stuff/init.sls)
        salt '*' state.apply stuff

        # Run the states configured in salt://stuff.sls (or salt://stuff/init.sls)
        # and salt://pkgs.sls (or salt://pkgs/init.sls).
        salt '*' state.apply stuff,pkgs

        # Run the states configured in a more deeply nested directory such as salt://my/organized/stuff.sls (or salt://my/organized/stuff/init.sls)
        salt '*' state.apply my.organized.stuff

    The following additional arguments are also accepted when applying
    individual SLS files:

    test
        Run states in test-only (dry-run) mode

    mock
        The mock option allows for the state run to execute without actually
        calling any states. This then returns a mocked return which will show
        the requisite ordering as well as fully validate the state run.

        New in version 2015.8.4

    pillar
        Custom Pillar values, passed as a dictionary of key-value pairs

            salt '*' state.apply stuff pillar='{"foo": "bar"}'

        Note:
            Values passed this way will override Pillar values set via
            ``pillar_roots`` or an external Pillar source.

    queue : False
        Instead of failing immediately when another state run is in progress,
        a value of ``True`` will queue the new state run to begin running once
        the other has finished.

        This option starts a new thread for each queued state run, so use this
        option sparingly.

        Changed in version 3006.0
            This parameter can also be set via the ``state_queue`` configuration
            option. Additionally, it can now be set to an integer representing
            the maximum queue size which can be attained before the state runs
            will fail to be queued. This can prevent runaway conditions where
            new threads are started until system performance is hampered.

    concurrent : False
        Execute state runs concurrently instead of serially

        Warning:

            This flag is potentially dangerous. It is designed for use when
            multiple state runs can safely be run at the same time. Do *not*
            use this flag for performance optimization.

    saltenv
        Specify a salt fileserver environment to be used when applying states

        Changed in version 0.17.0
            Argument name changed from ``env`` to ``saltenv``

        Changed in version 2014.7.0
            If no saltenv is specified, the minion config will be checked for an
            ``environment`` parameter and if found, it will be used. If none is
            found, ``base`` will be used. In prior releases, the minion config
            was not checked and ``base`` would always be assumed when the
            saltenv was not explicitly set.

    pillarenv
        Specify a Pillar environment to be used when applying states. This
        can also be set in the minion config file using the
        :conf_minion:`pillarenv` option. When neither the
        :conf_minion:`pillarenv` minion config option nor this CLI argument is
        used, all Pillar environments will be merged together.

    localconfig
        Optionally, instead of using the minion config, load minion opts from
        the file specified by this argument, and then merge them with the
        options from the minion config. This functionality allows for specific
        states to be run with their own custom minion configuration, including
        different pillars, file_roots, etc.

            salt '*' state.apply stuff localconfig=/path/to/minion.yml

    sync_mods
        If specified, the desired custom module types will be synced prior to
        running the SLS files:

            salt '*' state.apply stuff sync_mods=states,modules
            salt '*' state.apply stuff sync_mods=all

        Note:
            This option is ignored when no SLS files are specified, as a
            :ref:`highstate <running-highstate>` automatically syncs all custom
            module types.

        New in version 2017.7.8,2018.3.3,2019.2.0

    state_events
        The state_events option sends progress events as each function in
        a state run completes execution.

        New in version 3006.0
    

state.check_request:

    New in version 2015.5.0

    Return the state request information, if any

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.check_request
    

state.clear_cache:

    Clear out cached state files, forcing even cache runs to refresh the cache
    on the next state execution.

    Remember that the state cache is completely disabled by default, this
    execution only applies if cache=True is used in states

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.clear_cache
    

state.clear_request:

    New in version 2015.5.0

    Clear out the state execution request without executing it

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.clear_request
    

state.disable:

    Disable state runs.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.disable highstate

        salt '*' state.disable highstate,test.succeed_without_changes

    Note:
        To disable a state file from running provide the same name that would
        be passed in a state.sls call.

        salt '*' state.disable bind.config

    

state.enable:

    Enable state function or sls run

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.enable highstate

        salt '*' state.enable test.succeed_without_changes

    Note:
        To enable a state file from running provide the same name that would
        be passed in a state.sls call.

        salt '*' state.disable bind.config

    

state.event:

    Watch Salt's event bus and block until the given tag is matched

    New in version 2016.3.0
    Changed in version 2019.2.0
        ``tagmatch`` can now be either a glob or regular expression.

    This is useful for utilizing Salt's event bus from shell scripts or for
    taking simple actions directly from the CLI.

    Enable debug logging to see ignored events.

    :param tagmatch: the event is written to stdout for each tag that matches
        this glob or regular expression.
    :param count: this number is decremented for each event that matches the
        ``tagmatch`` parameter; pass ``-1`` to listen forever.
    :param quiet: do not print to stdout; just block
    :param sock_dir: path to the Salt master's event socket file.
    :param pretty: Output the JSON all on a single line if ``False`` (useful
        for shell tools); pretty-print the JSON output if ``True``.
    :param node: Watch the minion-side or master-side event bus.

    CLI Example:

        salt-call --local state.event pretty=True
    

state.get_pauses:

    Get a report on all of the currently paused state runs and pause
    run settings.
    Optionally send in a jid if you only desire to see a single pause
    data set.
    

state.high:

    Execute the compound calls stored in a single set of high data

    This function is mostly intended for testing the state system and is not
    likely to be needed in everyday usage.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.high '{"vim": {"pkg": ["installed"]}}'
    

state.highstate:

    Retrieve the state data from the salt master for this minion and execute it

    test
        Run states in test-only (dry-run) mode

    pillar
        Custom Pillar values, passed as a dictionary of key-value pairs

            salt '*' state.highstate stuff pillar='{"foo": "bar"}'

        Note:
            Values passed this way will override Pillar values set via
            ``pillar_roots`` or an external Pillar source.

        Changed in version 2016.3.0
            GPG-encrypted CLI Pillar data is now supported via the GPG
            renderer. See :ref:`here <encrypted-cli-pillar-data>` for details.

    pillar_enc
        Specify which renderer to use to decrypt encrypted data located within
        the ``pillar`` value. Currently, only ``gpg`` is supported.

        New in version 2016.3.0

    exclude
        Exclude specific states from execution. Accepts a list of sls names, a
        comma-separated string of sls names, or a list of dictionaries
        containing ``sls`` or ``id`` keys. Glob-patterns may be used to match
        multiple states.

            salt '*' state.highstate exclude=bar,baz
            salt '*' state.highstate exclude=foo*
            salt '*' state.highstate exclude="[{'id': 'id_to_exclude'}, {'sls': 'sls_to_exclude'}]"

    saltenv
        Specify a salt fileserver environment to be used when applying states

        Changed in version 0.17.0
            Argument name changed from ``env`` to ``saltenv``.

        Changed in version 2014.7.0
            If no saltenv is specified, the minion config will be checked for a
            ``saltenv`` parameter and if found, it will be used. If none is
            found, ``base`` will be used. In prior releases, the minion config
            was not checked and ``base`` would always be assumed when the
            saltenv was not explicitly set.

    pillarenv
        Specify a Pillar environment to be used when applying states. This
        can also be set in the minion config file using the
        :conf_minion:`pillarenv` option. When neither the
        :conf_minion:`pillarenv` minion config option nor this CLI argument is
        used, all Pillar environments will be merged together.

    queue : False
        Instead of failing immediately when another state run is in progress,
        a value of ``True`` will queue the new state run to begin running once
        the other has finished.

        This option starts a new thread for each queued state run, so use this
        option sparingly.

        Changed in version 3006.0
            This parameter can also be set via the ``state_queue`` configuration
            option. Additionally, it can now be set to an integer representing
            the maximum queue size which can be attained before the state runs
            will fail to be queued. This can prevent runaway conditions where
            new threads are started until system performance is hampered.

    concurrent : False
        Execute state runs concurrently instead of serially

        Warning:

            This flag is potentially dangerous. It is designed for use when
            multiple state runs can safely be run at the same time. Do *not*
            use this flag for performance optimization.

    localconfig
        Optionally, instead of using the minion config, load minion opts from
        the file specified by this argument, and then merge them with the
        options from the minion config. This functionality allows for specific
        states to be run with their own custom minion configuration, including
        different pillars, file_roots, etc.

    mock
        The mock option allows for the state run to execute without actually
        calling any states. This then returns a mocked return which will show
        the requisite ordering as well as fully validate the state run.

        New in version 2015.8.4

    state_events
        The state_events option sends progress events as each function in
        a state run completes execution.

        New in version 3006.0

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' state.highstate

        salt '*' state.highstate whitelist=sls1_to_run,sls2_to_run
        salt '*' state.highstate exclude=sls_to_exclude
        salt '*' state.highstate exclude="[{'id': 'id_to_exclude'}, {'sls': 'sls_to_exclude'}]"

        salt '*' state.highstate pillar="{foo: 'Foo!', bar: 'Bar!'}"
    

state.id_exists:

    Tests for the existence of a specific ID or list of IDs within the
    specified SLS file(s). Similar to :py:func:`state.sls_exists
    <salt.modules.state.sls_exists>`, returns True or False. The default
    environment is base``, use ``saltenv`` to specify a different environment.

    New in version 2019.2.0

    saltenv
        Specify a salt fileserver environment from which to look for the SLS files
        specified in the ``mods`` argument

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.list_disabled
    

state.low:

    Execute a single low data call

    This function is mostly intended for testing the state system and is not
    likely to be needed in everyday usage.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.low '{"state": "pkg", "fun": "installed", "name": "vi"}'
    

state.orchestrate:

    New in version 2016.11.0

        salt-call --local state.orchestrate webserver saltenv=dev pillarenv=aws
    

state.pause:

    Set up a state id pause, this instructs a running state to pause at a given
    state id. This needs to pass in the jid of the running state and can
    optionally pass in a duration in seconds. If a state_id is not passed then
    the jid referenced will be paused at the beginning of the next state run.

    The given state id is the id got a given state execution, so given a state
    that looks like this:

        vim:
          pkg.installed: []

    The state_id to pass to `pause` is `vim`

    CLI Examples:

state.request:

    New in version 2015.5.0

    Request that the local admin execute a state run via
    `salt-call state.run_request`.
    All arguments match those of state.apply.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.request
        salt '*' state.request stuff
        salt '*' state.request stuff,pkgs
    

state.resume:

    Remove a pause from a jid, allowing it to continue. If the state_id is
    not specified then the a general pause will be resumed.

    The given state_id is the id got a given state execution, so given a state
    that looks like this:

        vim:
          pkg.installed: []

    The state_id to pass to `rm_pause` is `vim`

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' state.resume 20171130110407769519
        salt '*' state.resume 20171130110407769519 vim
    

state.run_request:

    Execute the pending state request

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.run_request
    

state.running:

    Return a list of strings that contain state return data if a state function
    is already running. This function is used to prevent multiple state calls
    from being run at the same time.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.running
    

state.show_highstate:

    Retrieve the highstate data from the salt master and display it

    Custom Pillar data can be passed with the ``pillar`` kwarg.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.show_highstate
    

state.show_low_sls:

    Display the low data from a specific sls. The default environment is
    ``base``, use ``saltenv`` to specify a different environment.

    pillar
        Custom Pillar values, passed as a dictionary of key-value pairs

            salt '*' state.show_low_sls stuff pillar='{"foo": "bar"}'

        Note:
            Values passed this way will override Pillar values set via
            ``pillar_roots`` or an external Pillar source.

    pillarenv
        Specify a Pillar environment to be used when applying states. This
        can also be set in the minion config file using the
        :conf_minion:`pillarenv` option. When neither the
        :conf_minion:`pillarenv` minion config option nor this CLI argument is
        used, all Pillar environments will be merged together.

    Display the state data from a specific sls or list of sls files on the
    master. The default environment is ``base``, use ``saltenv`` to specify a
    different environment.

    This function does not support topfiles.  For ``top.sls`` please use
    ``show_top`` instead.

    Custom Pillar data can be passed with the ``pillar`` kwarg.

    saltenv
        Specify a salt fileserver environment to be used when applying states

    pillarenv

    Return the top data that the minion will use for a highstate

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.show_top
    

state.single:

    Execute a single state function with the named kwargs, returns False if
    insufficient data is sent to the command

    By default, the values of the kwargs will be parsed as YAML. So, you can
    specify lists values, or lists of single entry key-value maps, as you
    would in a YAML salt file. Alternatively, JSON format of keyword values
    is also supported.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.single pkg.installed name=vim

    

state.sls:

    Execute the states in one or more SLS files

    test
        Run states in test-only (dry-run) mode

        Custom Pillar values, passed as a dictionary of key-value pairs

            salt '*' state.sls stuff pillar='{"foo": "bar"}'

        Note:
            Values passed this way will override existing Pillar values set via
            ``pillar_roots`` or an external Pillar source.  Pillar values that
            are not included in the kwarg will not be overwritten.

        Changed in version 2016.3.0
            GPG-encrypted CLI Pillar data is now supported via the GPG
            renderer. See :ref:`here <encrypted-cli-pillar-data>` for details.

    exclude
        Exclude specific states from execution. Accepts a list of sls names, a
        comma-separated string of sls names, or a list of dictionaries
        containing ``sls`` or ``id`` keys. Glob-patterns may be used to match
        multiple states.

            salt '*' state.sls foo,bar,baz exclude=bar,baz

    saltenv
        Specify a salt fileserver environment to be used when applying states

        Changed in version 0.17.0
            Argument name changed from ``env`` to ``saltenv``.

        Changed in version 2014.7.0
            If no saltenv is specified, the minion config will be checked for an
            ``environment`` parameter and if found, it will be used. If none is
            found, ``base`` will be used. In prior releases, the minion config
            was not checked and ``base`` would always be assumed when the
            saltenv was not explicitly set.

    pillarenv
        Specify a Pillar environment to be used when applying states. This
        can also be set in the minion config file using the
        :conf_minion:`pillarenv` option. When neither the

        The state_events option sends progress events as each function in
        a state run completes execution.

        New in version 3006.0

    CLI Example:

        # Run the states configured in salt://example.sls (or salt://example/init.sls)
        salt '*' state.apply example

        # Run the states configured in salt://core.sls (or salt://core/init.sls)
        # and salt://edit/vim.sls (or salt://edit/vim/init.sls)

        salt '*' state.sls myslsfile pillar="{foo: 'Foo!', bar: 'Bar!'}"
    

state.sls_exists:

    Tests for the existence the of a specific SLS or list of SLS files on the
    master. Similar to :py:func:`state.show_sls <salt.modules.state.show_sls>`,
    rather than returning state details, returns True or False. The default
    environment is ``base``, use ``saltenv`` to specify a different environment.

    New in version 2019.2.0

    saltenv
        Specify a salt fileserver environment from which to look for the SLS files
        specified in the ``mods`` argument

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.sls_exists core,edit.vim saltenv=dev

    id
        ID to call

    mods
        Comma-delimited list of modules to search for given id and its requisites

    New in version 2014.7.0

    saltenv : base
        Specify a salt fileserver environment to be used when applying states

    pillarenv
        Specify a Pillar environment to be used when applying states. This
        can also be set in the minion config file using the
        :conf_minion:`pillarenv` option. When neither the
        :conf_minion:`pillarenv` minion config option nor this CLI argument is
        used, all Pillar environments will be merged together.

    pillar
        Custom Pillar values, passed as a dictionary of key-value pairs

            salt '*' state.sls_id my_state my_module pillar='{"foo": "bar"}'

        Note:
            Values passed this way will override existing Pillar values set via
            ``pillar_roots`` or an external Pillar source.  Pillar values that
            are not included in the kwarg will not be overwritten.

        New in version 2018.3.0

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.sls_id my_state my_module

        salt '*' state.sls_id my_state my_module,a_common_module
    

state.soft_kill:

    Set up a state run to die before executing the given state id,
    this instructs a running state to safely exit at a given
    state id. This needs to pass in the jid of the running state.
    If a state_id is not passed then the jid referenced will be safely exited
    at the beginning of the next state run.

    The given state id is the id got a given state execution, so given a state
    that looks like this:

        vim:
          pkg.installed: []

    The state_id to pass to `soft_kill` is `vim`

    CLI Examples:

        salt '*' state.soft_kill 20171130110407769519
        salt '*' state.soft_kill 20171130110407769519 vim
    

state.template:

    Execute the information stored in a template file on the minion.

    This function does not ask a master for a SLS file to render but
    instead directly processes the file at the provided path on the minion.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.template '<Path to template on the minion>'
    

state.template_str:

    Execute the information stored in a string from an sls template

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' state.template_str '<Template String>'
    

state.test:

    New in version 3001

    Alias for `state.apply` with the kwarg `test` forced to `True`.

    This is a nicety to avoid the need to type out `test=True` and the possibility of
    a typo causing changes you do not intend.
    

state.top:

    Execute a specific top file instead of the default. This is useful to apply
    configurations from a different environment (for example, dev or prod), without
    modifying the default top file.

    queue : False
        Instead of failing immediately when another state run is in progress,
        a value of ``True`` will queue the new state run to begin running once
        the other has finished.

        This option starts a new thread for each queued state run, so use this
        option sparingly.

        Changed in version 3006.0
            This parameter can also be set via the ``state_queue`` configuration
            option. Additionally, it can now be set to an integer representing
            the maximum queue size which can be attained before the state runs
            will fail to be queued. This can prevent runaway conditions where
            new threads are started until system performance is hampered.

    saltenv
        Specify a salt fileserver environment to be used when applying states

    pillarenv
        Specify a Pillar environment to be used when applying states. This
        can also be set in the minion config file using the
        :conf_minion:`pillarenv` option. When neither the
        :conf_minion:`pillarenv` minion config option nor this CLI argument is
        used, all Pillar environments will be merged together.

        Note that the Salt command line parser parses the date/time
        before we obtain the argument (preventing us from doing UTC)
        Therefore the argument must be passed in as a string.
        Meaning the text might have to be quoted twice on the command line.

    :param str utc_offset: The UTC offset in 4 digit (``+0600``) format with an
        optional sign (``+``/``-``).  Will default to ``None`` which will use the local

        New in version 2015.5.3


    cert_path
        full path to the certificates directory

    cert_filename
        alternative filename for the certificate, useful when using special
        characters in the CN. If this option is set it will override
        the certificate filename output effects of ``cert_type``.
        ``type_ext`` will be completely overridden.

        New in version 2015.5.3


    digest
        The message digest algorithm. Must be a string describing a digest
        algorithm supported by OpenSSL (by EVP_get_digestbyname, specifically).
        For example, "md5" or "sha1". Default: 'sha256'
    replace
        Replace this certificate even if it exists

        New in version 2015.5.1

    cert_type
        string. Either 'server' or 'client' (see create_csr() for details).

        If create_csr(type_ext=True) this function **must** be called with the
        same cert_type so it can find the CSR file.

    Note:
        create_csr() defaults to cert_type='server'; therefore, if it was also
        called with type_ext, cert_type becomes a required argument for
        create_ca_signed_cert()

    type_ext
        bool. If set True, use ``cert_type`` as an extension to the CN when
        formatting the filename.

        e.g.: some_subject_CN_server.crt or some_subject_CN_client.crt

        This facilitates the context where both types are required for the same
        subject

        If ``cert_filename`` is `not None`, setting ``type_ext`` has no
        effect

    If the following values were set:

        ca.cert_base_path='/etc/pki'
        ca_name='koji'
        CN='test.egavas.org'

    the resulting signed certificate would be written in the following
    location:

        /etc/pki/koji/certs/test.egavas.org.crt

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' tls.create_ca_signed_cert test localhost

    C
        country, default is "US"
    ST
        state, default is "Utah"
    L
        locality, default is "Centerville", the city where SaltStack originated

    emailAddress
        email address for the request, default is None
    subjectAltName
        valid subjectAltNames in full form, e.g. to add DNS entry you would call
        this function with this value:

        examples: ['DNS:somednsname.com',
                'DNS:1.2.3.4',
                'IP:1.2.3.4',
                'IP:2001:4801:7821:77:be76:4eff:fe11:e51',
                'email:me@i.like.pie.com']

    Note:
        some libraries do not properly query IP: prefixes, instead looking
        for the given req. source with a DNS: prefix. To be thorough, you
        may want to include both DNS: and IP: entries if you are using
        subjectAltNames for destinations for your TLS connections.
        e.g.:
        requests to https://1.2.3.4 will fail from python's
        requests library w/out the second entry in the above list

    New in version 2015.8.0

    cert_type
        Specify the general certificate type. Can be either `server` or
        `client`. Indicates the set of common extensions added to the CSR.

            }

    type_ext
        boolean.  Whether or not to extend the filename with CN_[cert_type]
        This can be useful if a server and client certificate are needed for
        the same CN. Defaults to False to avoid introducing an unexpected file
        naming pattern

        The files normally named some_subject_CN.csr and some_subject_CN.key
        will then be saved

vault.clear_cache:

    New in version 3007.0

    Delete Vault caches. Will ensure the current token and associated leases
    are revoked by default.

    The cache is organized in a hierarchy: ``/vault/connection/session/leases``.
    (*italics* mark data that is only cached when receiving configuration from a master)

    ``connection`` contains KV metadata (by default), *configuration* and *(AppRole) auth credentials*.
    ``session`` contains the currently active token.
    ``leases`` contains leases issued to the currently active token like database credentials.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' vault.clear_cache
        salt '*' vault.clear_cache session=True

    connection
        Only clear the cached data scoped to a connection. This includes
        configuration, auth credentials, the currently active auth token
        as well as leases and KV metadata (by default). Defaults to true.
        Set this to false to clear all Vault caches.

    session
        Only clear the cached data scoped to a session. This only includes
        leases and the currently active auth token, but not configuration
        or (AppRole) auth credentials. Defaults to false.
        Setting this to true will keep the connection cache, regardless
        of ``connection``.

            capabilities = ["delete"]
        }

        # KV v2 versions
        path "<mount>/delete/<secret>" {
            capabilities = ["update"]
        }

    path
        The path to the secret, including mount.

    New in version 3007.0

        combination is not found, an exception will be raised, unless a default
        is provided.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' vault.list_secrets "secret/my/"

    Required policy:

        path "<mount>/<path>" {

        New in version 3007.0

        This function used to return a dictionary like ``{"keys": ["some/", "some/key"]}``.
        Setting this to True will only return the list of keys.
        For backwards-compatibility reasons, this defaults to False.
    

vault.patch_secret:

    Patch secret dataset at <path>. Fields are specified as arbitrary keyword arguments.

    Note:

        This works even for older Vault versions, KV v1 and with missing
        ``patch`` capability, but will use more than one request to simulate
        the functionality by issuing a read and update request.

        For proper, single-request patching, requires versions of KV v2 that
        support the ``patch`` capability and the ``patch`` capability to be available
        for the path.

    Note:

        This uses JSON Merge Patch format internally.
        Keys set to ``null`` (JSON/YAML)/``None`` (Python) will be deleted.

    CLI Example:

            salt '*' vault.patch_secret "secret/my/secret" password="baz"

    Filesystem geometry options:

    * **bso**: Block size options.
    * **gmo**: Global metadata options.
    * **dso**: Data section options. These options specify the location, size,
               and other parameters of the data section of the filesystem.
    * **ino**: Inode options to specify the inode size of the filesystem, and other inode allocation parameters.
    * **lso**: Log section options.
    * **nmo**: Naming options.
    * **rso**: Realtime section options.

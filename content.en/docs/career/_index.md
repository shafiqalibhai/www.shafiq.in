Notes on Career, Contracting, Entrepreneurship, business goals, business development.

**Consulting Framework**

To determine the viability of a consulting project, consider the following factors:

1. **Can the client easily find a solution online?**

* Ideally, the answer should be "no", indicating that the problem requires specialized expertise.

2. **What are the consequences of a failed solution?**

* The cost of failure should be significant, but not catastrophic. This could include financial losses, reputational damage, or operational disruptions.

3. **How quickly can you deliver a solution?**

* The faster you can deliver a working solution, the better. This demonstrates your value to the client and helps build trust.

4. **How confident are you in your ability to deliver a great solution?**

* You should be 100% confident in your ability to deliver a high-quality solution. Anything less may undermine the client's trust and make it harder to close the deal.

**Problem Assessment**

Take the person you want to help and the top problem you identified earlier, and rate it out of 10 in the following categories:

* **PAIN**: _____ (high for high pain, low for low pain)
* **PLEASURE**: _____ (high for high pleasure, low for low pleasure)
* **LABOR**: _____ (high for high labor, low for low labor)
* **INFORMATION**: _____ (high for high information, low for low information)

**Pre-Contract Tasks**

Before starting a contract, consider the following:

* Is a **BPSS check** necessary?
* Is a **DBS check** necessary?
* Is the start date dependent on the client providing a laptop and completing setup?

**Red Flags and Lessons Learned**

* Be cautious when:
  * Code reviews are done by someone not actively working with you or partially working with you.
  * Organizations use ServiceNow for project requests instead of support/change tickets.
  * There are no operational tasks done in a squad/team.
  * The lead engineer is not working on your project.
* Best practices:
  * Get to know all ongoing projects before focusing on one.
  * Create a onboarding Jira ticket if possible.
  * Conduct 1-to-1 meetings with all team members.
  * Focus on making a positive impact and building workplace relationships rather than just performance.

**Questions to Ask the Client**

* Is the lead engineer working on AWS or Azure, etc.?
* Is ServiceNow used, and is it used for project delivery?
* Are there any operational tasks done by the team once the user story is delivered into the Production environment?
* Is there a code review process, and is the review done by another member of the same team who will be working with me on the same project?
* Are there daily standups?

**Wealth Creation Principles**

1. **Assets generate positive cash flow**: Focus on acquiring assets that produce income, rather than liabilities that drain resources.
 * Your primary residence is a liability, so consider investing in a third property as a buy-to-let (BTL) to generate passive income.
 * To maximize tax efficiency, consider setting up a limited company and contract outside of IR35.
2. **Cash flow is tax-free**: Understand that cash flow from assets is not taxed, making it a powerful tool for wealth creation.
 * Research jurisdictions with favorable tax laws for limited companies and bank accounts, ideally supported by payment processors like Stripe or PayPal.
3. **Types of income**:
 * Earned income: taxed
 * Portfolio income: taxed
 * Passive income (cash flow): not taxed
4. **Mastering debt**: Learn to leverage debt as a tool for wealth creation, rather than a liability.
5. **FICO score**: Understand the importance of maintaining a good credit score to access favorable financing options.
6. **Mentorship**: Find a successful entrepreneur or investor to guide you in your wealth creation journey.

**Product Development**

1. **Create a unique value proposition**: Ensure your product offers a significant improvement over existing solutions.
2. **Survivability**: Ask yourself if your product would withstand negative publicity or a crisis.
3. **Roles**:
 * Inventor: builds the product
 * Entrepreneur: takes the product to market
 * CEO: manages the team
4. **Intellectual property protection**: Consider patenting your product to safeguard your idea.
5. **Elevator pitch**: Craft a 120-second pitch for investors, covering:
 * Problem statement
 * Unique solution
 * IP protection
 * Market demand and growth
 * Team experience
 * Financial requirements
 * Clear roadmap
6. **Exit strategy**: Plan for a successful exit, whether through acquisition, IPO, or other means.

**Investing and Networking**

1. **Socialize with successful people**: Connect with affluent individuals in your community to learn from their experiences.
2. **Commodity investing**: Consider investing in commodities as a hedge against inflation.
3. **Stock market caution**: Be aware of potential inflation and market volatility.
4. **Real estate as a business**: Treat real estate investing as a business, with a focus on cash flow and wealth creation.

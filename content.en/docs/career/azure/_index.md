## Azure Networking

Azure networking is a set of services that enables communication between different resources within the Azure cloud. It includes virtual networks (VNets), which allow you to create isolated networks in the cloud, as well as various other services such as load balancers, firewall rules, and VPN connections.

Some key concepts to understand when working with Azure networking include:

- Virtual networks (VNets): These are the fundamental building blocks of Azure networking. VNets allow you to create isolated networks in the cloud, where you can deploy resources such as virtual machines and storage accounts.

- Subnets: Subnets are used to divide a VNet into smaller, more manageable segments. This allows you to control network access and security at a more granular level.

- Network Security Groups (NSGs): NSGs are used to control inbound and outbound traffic to resources within a VNet. They allow you to create firewall rules that can be applied at the subnet or individual resource level.

- Load balancers: Azure Load Balancer provides network load balancing services for your Azure resources. It automatically distributes incoming network traffic across multiple resources, such as virtual machines, to optimize performance and availability.

- VPN and ExpressRoute: Azure Virtual Network Gateway allows you to create secure, private connections between Azure VNets and on-premises networks using VPN and ExpressRoute. This enables you to easily connect your on-premises resources to Azure.

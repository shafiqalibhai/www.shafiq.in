### Introducing BottomToolBar: A Customizable Tool for Your Website

Have you ever noticed the sliding bar at the bottom of your TV screen displaying text messages and images? It's a common feature on news channels and entertainment programs. BottomToolBar (BTB) takes that concept and brings it to your website, enhancing user engagement and content discovery.

### What is BottomToolBar?

The BottomToolBar is a feature that can be added to any website. It sits at the bottom of the web browser and stays on top of all other webpage elements. It functions much like the scrolling ticker you see on news websites but with additional customizability, such as:

#### Core Features
- **Sticky Placement**: Always resides at the bottom of your web browser.
- **Layering**: Stays on top of all other webpage elements.
- **Dynamic Content**: Fetches text and images from a server to display.
- **Text Scrolling**: Messages slide from right to left or vice versa.
- **Icon Separation**: Texts are separated by custom images, often the website's logo.
- **Emoji Support**: Supports emojis, similar to those in MSN chats.
- **Multimedia Display**: Can show pictures as part of the sliding text.
- **User Interactivity**: Allows users to move the toolbar around.
- **Analytics**: Tracks how many people see each message and how many choose to close the toolbar.
- **User Preference**: Offers users the choice to see the toolbar, with options to remember their selection.

#### Control Panel
From the control panel, website administrators can:

- **Tag Creation**: Define tags for each website.
- **Custom Image**: Choose an image to separate the text.
- **Text Frequency**: Define how many times a specific text should appear.
- **Scroll Direction**: Choose the scrolling direction (rtl or ltr).
- **Background Color**: Customize the background color.
- **Content Source**: Select the source for text and images.
- **Image Positioning**: Define where the image will be placed within the text.
- **Display Timing**: Set how long an image or text will be displayed.
- **User Authentication**: Optional feature for users to log in and create their toolbar.
- **Admin Approval**: Messages can be approved or disapproved by the admin based on privileges.

### Examples
- **Gmail's Chat feature**: Like the Gmail Chat feature in web browsers, the BottomToolBar stays on top of all other elements.

The BottomToolBar is a comprehensive, dynamic tool designed to make websites more interactive and engaging. It's fully customizable to suit the needs of different kinds of websites, from news portals to entertainment sites.

So if you're looking to give your website that extra bit of functionality and pizazz, BottomToolBar could be just the solution you're looking for.

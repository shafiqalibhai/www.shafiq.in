To determine the viability of a consulting project, consider the following factors:

1. **Can the client easily find a solution online?**

* Ideally, the answer should be "no", indicating that the problem requires specialized expertise.

2. **What are the consequences of a failed solution?**

* The cost of failure should be significant, but not catastrophic. This could include financial losses, reputational damage, or operational disruptions.

3. **How quickly can you deliver a solution?**

* The faster you can deliver a working solution, the better. This demonstrates your value to the client and helps build trust.

4. **How confident are you in your ability to deliver a great solution?**

* You should be 100% confident in your ability to deliver a high-quality solution. Anything less may undermine the client's trust and make it harder to close the deal.

Before starting a contract, consider the following:

* Is a **BPSS check** necessary?
* Is a **DBS check** necessary?
* Is the start date dependent on the client providing a laptop and completing setup?

**Red Flags and Lessons Learned**

* Be cautious when:
  * Code reviews are done by someone not actively working with you or partially working with you.
  * Organizations use ServiceNow for project requests instead of support/change tickets.
  * There are no operational tasks done in a squad/team.
  * The lead engineer is not working on your project.
* Best practices:
  * Get to know all ongoing projects before focusing on one.
  * Create a onboarding Jira ticket if possible.
  * Conduct 1-to-1 meetings with all team members.
  * Focus on making a positive impact and building workplace relationships rather than just performance.

**Questions to Ask the Client**

* Is the lead engineer working on AWS or Azure, etc.?
* Is ServiceNow used, and is it used for project delivery?
* Are there any operational tasks done by the team once the user story is delivered into the Production environment?
* Is there a code review process, and is the review done by another member of the same team who will be working with me on the same project?
* Are there daily standups?

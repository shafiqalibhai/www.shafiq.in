That display shows "1" which indicates an overrange or out-of-range reading. This typically means one of two things:

**Most likely cause:** The dial is set to a voltage range that's too low for what you're trying to measure.

**Solutions:**
1. **Turn the dial to a higher voltage setting** - Try the "200" setting in the DC voltage (V⎓) section instead of "20". This will handle voltages up to 200V.

2. **Check your connections** - Make sure:
   - The black probe is firmly in the "COM" port
   - The red probe is firmly in the "VΩmA" port
   - You're making good contact with the battery terminals

3. **Verify the battery orientation** - Make sure you're touching:
   - Black probe to the negative (-) end of the battery
   - Red probe to the positive (+) end of the battery

Try turning the dial to "200" in the DC voltage section first - that should give you a proper reading for most batteries. If you're still getting "1" on the display, then there might be a connection issue or the battery might be completely dead.

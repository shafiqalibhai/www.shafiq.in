## Key Life Advice from People in Their 40s to Those in Their 20s

### **Physical Health & Self-Care**
- Take care of your teeth - they're the only set you'll ever have
- Take care of your knees and back
- Stretch every day or at least more than never - stay limber because once flexibility is gone, it's almost impossible to get back
- Don't wait to get in shape - start working out now in whatever way you enjoy
- Use sunscreen and drink plenty of water

### **Mental Health & Self-Perception**
- Stop caring what other people think - this was one of the most emphasized points
- You're not special, no one cares what you do, and the sooner you accept it, the sooner you can be at peace with yourself
- Don't take yourself too seriously - you'll probably look back ten years later mildly mortified at how deep you thought you were
- It's okay and healthy to sit in silence - put down your phone and just be

### **Time & Life Perspective**
- Time goes by very fast - never waste a day
- Chase your dreams! You don't want to be 80 years old regretting not traveling or pursuing your passion
- You don't have as much time as you think you do - do something every day, even if it's just for yourself

### **Social Comparisons & Life Timelines**
- Don't fall into the trap of thinking everyone else your age has something you don't
- Once you're out of school, there are no timelines anymore - you're not supposed to do anything by any particular point in your life
- Don't worry about high school - once you're done, no one cares except for getting your diploma

### **Relationships & Social Life**
- Choose friends wisely - don't keep friends who bring you down, only call when they need something, or discourage your growth
- Just ask - whether it's the person who gets your heart beating or the pay raise you deserve, things won't come to you by themselves

### **Financial Wisdom**
- Save money and invest - investments roughly double every decade
- Doing something you like for a living is more rewarding than doing something that pays exceptionally well

### **Personal Growth**
- Fail more - failure is not a catastrophe but part of the process of getting better
- Deprogram yourself from societal lies and examine your beliefs thoroughly
- Learn to live in the present - the past is just memory and the future is imagination

I am happy to share with you my first Google Chrome extension.

It is a collection of Typo3 reference manuals that I have compiled from the typo3.org website.

It may not be the coolest extension out there, but it has been useful to me. 🙂

This Google Chrome extension is for:

• Those who have a slow or unreliable internet connection. For example, in India.
• And those who prefer to stay in the browser while reading or searching something in the Typo3 swx reference manuals.

I wanted to publish this extension on the Google Chrome Extension Directory, but I couldn't. The file size is 19.86 MB, and Google has a limit of 10 MB for extensions. If you know any workaround, please let me know.

Tip: use ctrl+F or F3 to search.

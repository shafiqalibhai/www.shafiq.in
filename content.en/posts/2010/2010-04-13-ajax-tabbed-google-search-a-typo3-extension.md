I'm excited to share with you _my first_ typo3 extension.

It's a front end plugin that lets you display a customized google search engine on your website. The search engine uses ajax technology and has tabs feature, so you can switch between different types of results without reloading the page.

<!-- Download Link : -->

You can download the extension from the typo3 forge project page. You can also access the svn repository and contribute to the code. 🙂

The team's development process defines who is doing what, when, and how.  
In the waterfall model, software activities proceed through a sequence of steps, with each step based on the activities of the previous step.  
The spiral model begins with a series of risk-driven prototypes, followed by a structured waterfall-like process.  
The iterative approach, a hybrid of the waterfall and spiral models, decouples the lifecycle phases from the software activities that take place in each phase.  
No matter what model you use, you must develop at least one early prototype to get customer feedback.

Confession time...
I always get confused about which one is the slash and which one is the backslash.
I end up calling them "the one on the question mark" and "the one not on the question mark".
Or / and \ for short.

Here's a simple trick:
\ leans back
/ leans forward

( is a slash that got bent out of shape
^ is a slash that got pinched in the middle
% is a forward slash with two dots on it
\# is four slashes that crossed paths
~ is a slash that had too much to drink

! is a slash that wears a hat and a sock.
i is the same slash doing a handstand.
? is the same slash but very old and wrinkled.
. is a slash that collapsed into a dot.
\`. is a slash that lost its soul.
{*} is something you don't want to see. Not a slash at all.

T is a horizontal slash that needs a vertical one to support it.

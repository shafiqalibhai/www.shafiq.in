## We haven't seen you for a while

It's been 7 days, 4 hours, 13 minutes and 2 seconds since you last logged in, and we're starting to get really worried.

We were just getting to know each other. You created 1 site, 1 page, dragged on 1 element, and then... nothing.

We were really excited for your new website, it had so much potential!

If you ran into any trouble along the way, we're here for you. Making your own website is fun, fast and easy with Weebly. Best of all, you will have a website of your own to show to customers, clients, family or friends.

So we'll make it really, really easy to start working on your Weebly website again: just click here!

If you have any questions, we'd love to help. Feel free to visit our Support Center or email us at <support@weebly.com>.

Sincerely,  
The Weebly Team

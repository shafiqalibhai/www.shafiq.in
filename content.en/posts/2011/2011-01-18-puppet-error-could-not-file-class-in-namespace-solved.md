## How to Solve the Puppet Error: Could not find class in namespace

Sometimes, when working with Puppet, you may encounter an error message that does not accurately reflect the actual problem. For example, if you see this error:

err: Could not retrieve catalog: Could not find class php in namespaces standardbuild at /etc/puppet/manifests/templates.pp:15 on domain.internal.com

One of the possible causes could be a missing curly bracket in your code. This can be hard to spot and can waste a lot of your time. To avoid this, make sure you check your syntax carefully and use a code editor that can highlight any errors for you.

# Abstract

The use of screen design and systems is influenced by various factors, such as the amount of information presented, screen organization, language used, and distinctiveness of screen components. This paper explores principles of screen design and proposes enhancing human-computer interaction through cognitive biometric and neural technology.

## Introduction

Human-computer interaction is essential in various industries and daily life. It focuses on how humans interact and control computer systems, aiming to make the interaction more comfortable and effective. The interface or screen plays a crucial role in this interaction, and designing a screen that allows users to comfortably complete tasks is vital. A well-designed screen reflects user capabilities, needs, and tasks, considering hardware constraints and achieving business objectives. Understanding screen design principles is crucial for designers to achieve these goals.

## Problem

Although human-computer interaction has advanced to allow direct touch interaction, it still requires motor work involving hands. This paper addresses the problem of current standards relying on hands or motor work, which may not always be desirable.

## My Idea

To reduce or eliminate the need for motor work in human-computer interaction, cognitive biometric techniques can be employed. This paper proposes using a brain-machine interface, where users can interact with the computer through their thoughts. By combining cognitive biometric techniques with screen design principles, users can effectively interact with the system in a hands-free and efficient manner. Understanding the principles of screen design is essential for implementing this idea.

## Screen Design Goals

To create an easy and pleasant interface, design goals should focus on reducing visual, intellectual, memory, and motor work. By achieving these goals, user productivity and satisfaction can be improved.

## Organizing Screen Elements Clearly and Meaningfully

Visual clarity is achieved when screen elements are organized in a meaningful and understandable way. This involves consistency in design, visually pleasing composition, logical ordering, presenting the right amount of information, and proper grouping and alignment. Visual clutter should be avoided to ensure clear and distinct elements.

## Ordering of Screen Data and Content

Information should be organized logically and sensibly, considering interrelationships. Screen units should be ordered based on user expectations and needs. Comparing information should be made easy, and irrelevant information should be avoided.

## Screen Navigation and Flow

Screen navigation should be intuitive and straightforward. Aligning control elements and using line borders can guide the user's eye. Attention should be drawn to the most important parts of the screen using various display techniques.

## Visually Pleasing Composition

Visually pleasing composition helps attract attention and convey a positive message. Balance, symmetry, and visual lines contribute to a composition's appeal and effectiveness.

## Amount of Information

Presenting the right amount of information is crucial. Too little information can be inefficient, while too much can be overwhelming. Important information should be presented prominently, and the page size should be limited.

## Web Page Size

Web page size should be kept to a minimum, limiting the content to two or three screens. Critical information should be placed at the top of the page for easy visibility.

## Scrolling and Paging

Scrolling should be minimized, and contextual cues should indicate the need to scroll for complete content. Clear page structures and consistent end-of-page indications should be provided.

## Distinctiveness

Screen controls and groups should be visually distinct. Borders should separate screen controls, and adjacent elements should have sufficient contrast. Distinctiveness can be enhanced through separation and contrast.

## Focus and Emphasis

Important elements and central ideas should be visually emphasized using techniques like brightness, font size, underlining, contrasting colors, and positioning. Overemphasizing elements or using too many techniques should be avoided.

## Conveying Depth of Levels or a Three-Dimensional Appearance

Creating a three-dimensional appearance using perspective, shading, and highlighting can enhance the visual appeal. Displaying command buttons above the screen plane and screen-based controls below the screen plane can add depth.

## Presenting Information Simply and Meaningfully

Information should be presented in a legible and readable manner. Utilizing contrasting display features, creating visual lines, maintaining consistency, and providing structure enhance the usability of information.

## Organization and Structure Guidelines

Specific screen types, such as information entry and modification screens, dedicated source documents, and display/read-only screens, require organizational and structural guidelines tailored to their purpose.

## Reading, Browsing, and Searching on the Web

Web pages are typically scanned in a clockwise direction, with users focusing on content rather than peripheral elements. Scanning, browsing, and searching guidelines can improve the user experience and information retrieval.

## Interaction through Brain-Machine Interface

The paper explores the concept of a brain-machine interface, where users can control systems using their thoughts. This interface detects brain signals through an electrode attached to the scalp or implanted into the gray matter. The signals are processed by computer software, allowing users to interact with the system effortlessly. The interface should be convenient, comfortable, and accessible to physically challenged individuals.

## Advantages

Designing an interface based on a brain-machine interface offers several advantages. It provides a convenient interaction method for physically challenged individuals and reduces the time required to perform tasks using traditional input methods. It also reduces stress, memory burden, and frustration caused by slow response times.

Human-computer interaction plays a crucial role in various industries and everyday life. Effective interaction is essential for user comfort and business success. Designing software and websites with effective screen design principles is crucial. Combining cognitive biometrics and neural technology with human-computer interaction can significantly improve the user experience. The brain-machine interface offers an easy and convenient way to interact with systems. This combination of technologies and principles creates a powerful and efficient interaction method.

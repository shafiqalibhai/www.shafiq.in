Hello everyone! Today I want to share with you the first project I ever did: the college website! This was a very old project that I did with the help of Subhash Dasyam. It was a great learning experience for me and I'm excited to tell you more about it.

## The Project

The college website was a simple static website that showcased the information and achievements of our college, ASTRA. It had pages for the departments, faculty, students, events, gallery, and contact. It also had a login system for the admin and the students.

## The Challenges

As this was my first project, I faced many challenges along the way. Some of them were:

- Learning HTML, CSS, and PHP from scratch. I had no prior knowledge of web development, so I had to learn everything from online tutorials and books.
- Designing the layout and appearance of the website. I had to choose the colors, fonts, images, and icons that matched the theme and style of our college.
- Testing and debugging the website on different browsers and devices. I had to make sure that the website worked properly on all platforms and looked consistent.
- Dealing with security issues. Our college network was not very secure, so we had to protect our website from hackers and viruses. We also had a php shell in there somewhere that we used for administrative purposes only. 🙂

## The Lessons

Despite the challenges, I learned a lot from this project. Some of the lessons I learned were:

- How to create a basic website using HTML, CSS, and PHP.
- How to use GitHub to host and share my code.
- How to collaborate with another developer and communicate effectively.
- How to solve problems creatively and logically.
- How to improve my skills and knowledge by learning from others.

This project was a milestone for me as it sparked my interest in web development and motivated me to pursue it further. I'm grateful to Subhash Dasyam for his guidance and support, and to Mrs. Aruna Ranganath (CSE Head of Department) for getting me involved.

Why are you asking me to pay in advance ... I had prebooked this 2 months back ... i believe on the first day itself ... now you are saying even after paying in advance i get the tablet in March !!!

---------------------------

P.S. This wouldn't have happened if they had done some capacity planning. They were planning to supply to all schools and colleges with the number of tablets that sold out in the first month ? Don't you think this is just another way to create hype and "demand" in the market. Cannot believe the government does business they way they do it in the grey market.

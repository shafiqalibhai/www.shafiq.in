Mastering the art of Continuous Delivery is about more than just pushing code onto a server. It's a delicate balance of managing your technology and the people who interact with it. One major stumbling block? The tiny differences between machines that happen when someone decides to make ad-hoc changes. These may seem trivial, but they can cause massive headaches when it comes to debugging and troubleshooting.

The endgame here is clear: Create a system so streamlined that there's no need for anyone to manually log in to make changes. Achieving this means fewer bugs, faster deployments, and ultimately, a happier team.

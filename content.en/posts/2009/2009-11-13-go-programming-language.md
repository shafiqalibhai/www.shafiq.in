Google came up with a new programming language called Go, which is supposed to be super fast and awesome and stuff.

But do we really need another language? I mean, come on. It's hard enough to keep up with the ones we already have.

Go has some cool things going on, like goroutines, channels and interfaces. But it also has some weird things, like no generics, no exceptions and no inheritance. So it's not for everyone.

If you're curious about Go, you can check it out and see if it works for you. Or you can just stick to what you know and love. Either way, Go is something new to code with.

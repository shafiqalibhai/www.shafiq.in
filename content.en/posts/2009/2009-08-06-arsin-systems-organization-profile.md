**Products**

**Arsin's QA Mapper**

This multi-user application is the command and control system for creating and maintaining test assets such as test requirements, test cases and test procedures. QA Mapper is composed of three major functional areas:

  1. Test Repository Management
  2. Test Data Management
  3. Test Execution and Reporting

The Test Repository Management feature includes the ability to create, edit and delete test components. These components can originate from the ATLaS Library™ (see Test Accelerator below) or can be built from scratch. Additionally, this Repository permits the creation, editing and deletion of test procedures by linking individual components. The Test Repository Manager provides a consolidated view of the test component configuration and corresponding screens, fields and test data.

The Test Data Management feature of QA Mapper eliminates the laborious creation and maintenance of test data spreadsheets common to "old-world" test automation solutions. It enables the creation of project specific and secure test data sets which can be easily maintained through a web based interface. Additionally, the creation of input test data is accelerated through automatic importing of master data from the system under test.

QA Mapper'sT browser based interface permits multiple users to execute tests. This feature also includes the generation of detailed test execution results and the capturing of data for tracking test automation performance.

**Arsin's ATLaS SAP® Test Accelerator**

This pre-built library is designed for testing the SAP ERP Suite of applications. The initial library components are focused on SAP ERP modules covering five major core critical business processes (47 sub-processes) involving 8 different modules. This library is configurable for unique customer implementations without the need for major rework. This is accomplished through meta-data based test component configuration. Additionally, the ATLaS LibraryT includes validation components which are built using the Effecta Validation engine's built-in intelligence and a knowledge base for advanced validation beyond static data validation. Advanced validation includes business rule based validation and configuration based validation.

**Memento Mori** refers to the philosophical reminder of death's inevitability. You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think. It helps you remember the good things without arrogance and to let the bad things go with indifference. You control whether you waste time getting upset by things. And whether you waste time taking things personally.

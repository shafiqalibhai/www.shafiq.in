**Amor fati** is a phrase that may be translated as "love of one's fate". It is used to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one's life, including suffering and loss, as good or, at the very least, necessary. You take what you can from life. You use it as fuel. You become better from it. You become improved by it. Make the most of it. Be better for it having happened.

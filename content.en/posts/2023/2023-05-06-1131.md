A vision board is a collage of images and words representing a person's wishes or goals, intended to serve as inspiration or motivation. It includes pictures and words that will help inspire you to manifest your dreams and get where you want to go. It's a way to document and organize what you want to achieve in your life while inspiring you to take action. Use vision boards for short-term and long-term goals in life.

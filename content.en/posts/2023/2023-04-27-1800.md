```bash
find . -name "*.md" -type f -exec sed -i '/line of text/d' {} \;
```

This command uses `find` to locate all `.md` files in the current directory and its subdirectories recursively. The `-exec` option is used to execute the `sed` command on each file found. The `{}` is replaced by the name of each file found, and the `\;` is used to terminate the `-exec` option.

The `sed` command removes any line containing the string "line of text" from each file found.

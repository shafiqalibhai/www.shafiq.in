1. **Install Ghostscript**: If it's not already installed, you can install Ghostscript using your distribution's package manager. For Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, use:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install ghostscript
   ```

   For Red Hat-based systems like Fedora, use:

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install ghostscript
   ```

2. **Compress the PDF**: Once Ghostscript is installed, you can compress your PDF file using the following command:

   ```bash
   gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=output.pdf input.pdf
   ```

   In this command:

   - `input.pdf` is the name of your original PDF file.
   - `output.pdf` is the name of the compressed PDF file that will be created.
   - `-dPDFSETTINGS=/screen` sets the quality of the PDF. This setting is for the lowest quality and smallest file size, which is suitable for viewing on a screen. Other options include `/ebook` for medium quality, `/printer` for high quality, and `/prepress` for high quality with large file size.

To reduce the compression level in Ghostscript when converting or processing a PDF file, you can adjust the `-dPDFSETTINGS` option. The command you provided is set to use the `/screen` setting, which applies high compression and low-resolution output, suitable for viewing on a screen but not ideal for printing or archiving.

The available settings for `-dPDFSETTINGS` are:

1. `/screen` – lowest quality, highest compression.
2. `/ebook` – better quality, but still a fair amount of compression.
3. `/printer` – high quality, suitable for printing documents.
4. `/prepress` – high quality, similar to `/printer` but with a higher resolution, suitable for printing to a prepress standard.
5. `/default` – a useful starting point, balancing quality and compression.

To reduce the compression level (i.e., to increase the quality of the output PDF), you can switch from `/screen` to a higher quality setting like `/ebook`, `/printer`, or `/prepress`. For example, if you want a balance between quality and file size, you might choose `/ebook`:

```bash
gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=patient-record-oldbury-health-centre-1.pdf patient-record-oldbury-health-centre.pdf
```

Or, for higher quality suitable for printing, use `/printer`:

```bash
gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/printer -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=patient-record-oldbury-health-centre-1.pdf patient-record-oldbury-health-centre.pdf
```

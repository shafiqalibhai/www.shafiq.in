BATNA stands for "Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement." It's a concept from negotiation theory that represents the most advantageous alternative course of action a party can take if negotiations fail and an agreement cannot be reached. Understanding your BATNA is crucial as it gives you a baseline against which to measure any proposed agreement. Here's a step-by-step guide to figuring out your BATNA:

1. **Identify Your Options:** Start by listing all possible alternatives you can pursue if the current negotiation doesn’t lead to a deal. Think broadly and creatively about all available options.

2. **Evaluate Each Alternative:** For each alternative on your list, evaluate its feasibility and the outcomes it might lead to. Consider the benefits and drawbacks, the resources required, and the likelihood of success.

3. **Estimate the Value of Each Alternative:** Assign a value to each alternative. This can be monetary or based on other factors like time, effort, opportunity cost, or personal satisfaction.

4. **Compare Alternatives:** Compare these alternatives to each other. This step helps in understanding which alternatives are better and why. It might be helpful to rank them in order of preference or desirability.

5. **Determine Your BATNA:** Your BATNA is the best option from this list. It's the alternative you would choose if the current negotiation falls through. Remember, your BATNA is not about what you hope to achieve but what you would realistically do if the negotiation doesn't work out.

6. **Keep Your BATNA Private:** Generally, it’s wise not to disclose your BATNA in a negotiation. Knowing your fallback position could weaken your negotiating stance.

7. **Reflect on the Other Party's BATNA:** If possible, try to understand the other party’s BATNA. This can provide valuable insights into their motivations and constraints, which can be useful in negotiations.

8. **Be Ready to Walk Away:** If the offer on the table is worse than your BATNA, be prepared to walk away from the negotiation. This can be a powerful position, as it shows you’re not dependent on reaching an agreement.

9. **Review and Adapt:** Situations can change, so it's important to periodically reassess your BATNA. New information or changes in circumstances might lead to a different evaluation.

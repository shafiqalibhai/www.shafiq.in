"No good deed ever goes unpunished."

Sometimes when you try to do something good or helpful, it can backfire and you end up in trouble or face negative consequences, sadly, even when you have the best intentions.

This can happen even when you are trying to be kind or helpful towards those closest to us, such as our parents. It’s an unfortunate reality that good deeds don’t always result in positive outcomes.
